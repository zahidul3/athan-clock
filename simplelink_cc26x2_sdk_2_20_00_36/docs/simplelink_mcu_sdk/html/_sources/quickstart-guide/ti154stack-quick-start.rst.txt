.. _quick-start-ti154stack-ccs:

Using |TIMAC| Projects with CCS
-------------------------------

Importing |TIMAC| projects into CCS will also import a ``README.html`` that
details the example application design, steps on running the example, and how
each example works.

Projects that contain the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile will also 
import the Boot Image Manager (BIM) into the workspace. For more information on TI OAD and the BIM see the `TI 15.4-Stack Users Guide`_.

For more details on TI 15.4-Stack example application please see the 
`TI 15.4-Stack Users Guide`_. 

Import Project Using Resource Explorer
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource 
Explorer in CCS.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the *sensor* project. All of |TIMAC| projects included
in the development kit have a similar structure.

#. Open the CCS IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. attention::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    -   Open Resource Explorer (if not open already) **View** -> **Resource
        Explorer** - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
        **Software ->** |SDK| **-> Examples ->** \ |DEVICE|\ \_LAUNCXL **->
        ti154stack -> sensor -> TI-RTOS -> CCS Compiler -> sensor**

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import project into Project Explorer

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceeed.

        .. _fig-ti154stack-resource-explorer-eula:
        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If everything is successful, the project should appear in Resource
      Explorer.


Import Project Using Import Wizard
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Open CCS
2. Choose Project -> Import CCS Projects from the menu.
3. Select the Browse button in the Import CCS Projects dialog and select the the directory
