TI BLE5-Stack Quick Start
*************************

This section serves as a road map for users developing applications
and products using the TI SimpleLink |DEVICE| wireless MCU platform for
Bluetooth low energy applications. Whether a seasoned developer or just getting
started, TI has created a variety of resources to simplify development on the
|DEVICE| platform. These resources will enhance your experience with the TI
SimpleLink |BLE5_STACK| |version| from the out-of-the-box demo to production.

:numref:`fig_ble5_suggested_workflow` shows the suggested work flow for getting
started with TI's SimpleLink Bluetooth low energy (BLE) development environment.

Using BLE5-Stack Projects with CCS
==================================

Importing BLE5-Stack app projects into CCS will also import BLE5-Stack stack
library projects into CCS. The stack library project is a dependent project and
will be automatically built when the example is built.

Projects that contain the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile will also
import the Boot Image Manager (BIM) into the workspace. For more information on
the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the **OAD Chapter** of the BLE5-Stack User's
Guide.

For more details and how to
change configurations look at the SimpleLink |BLE5_STACK| User’s Guide.

Import Project Using Resource Explorer
--------------------------------------

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer in CCS.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the project\_zero project. All of |BLE5_STACK| projects included
in the development kit have a similar structure.

#. Open the CCS IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Create a workspace.

    .. attention::

        Ensure that the CCS workspace path does not contain a whitespace.

#. Import a CCS Project using Resource Explorer

    - Open Resource Explorer (if not open already): View -> Resource Explorer
    - Navigate to the CCS folder for your chosen example:
      Software |rarr| |SDK| |rarr| Examples |rarr| |DEVBOARD| |rarr|
      ble5stack |rarr| project_zero |rarr| TI-RTOS |rarr| CCS Compiler |rarr|
      project_zero_app

    .. _fig-ccs-import-projects:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_ccs_import_project_zero.png
        :align: center

        Import CCS Projects

#.  Select the CCS Logo button to import project into Project Explorer

    .. attention::

        The import process will also install the |SDK| if a local version does
        not exist. You must accept the End User License Agreement to proceeed.

        .. _fig-resource-explorer-eula:
        .. figure:: resources/eula.png
            :align: center

            Install |SDK|

        After the installation finishes, you must reopen CCS before importing
        the project.

    - If you get a pop-up window with an error message, under "Details >>"
      saying "Error: A project with the name 'xx_stack_library' already exists
      in the workplace!", that is fine. You accidentally imported the stack
      twice. Just click OK.

    - If everything is successful, three projects should appear in Resource
      Explorer: one for the application code
      (ble5_project_zero_cc26x2r1lp_app), one for the stack code
      (ble5_project_zero_cc26x2r1lp_stack_library), and one for the BIM
      (cc26x2r1lp_bim_offchip).

    .. note::
        Not all projects in the |SDK| will have both an app and a stack library
        project. Refer to the relevant protocol Quick Start section for working
        with non-BLE5-Stack projects in the |SDK|.

        Projects Imported into CCS


Build and Download Project
--------------------------

For all build configurations, the Stack project should always be built before
the Application project. For projects containing the TI OAD Profile, it is
recommended to build the BIM first.

To build & download Project Zero:

#. Build the BIM project.

    - Set the BIM project as the active project. Make sure the Debug project
      configuration is used.
    - Select **Project** -> **Build All** to build the BIM project.

#. Load the BIM project

    - Select **Run** -> **Debug** to download the BIM
    - Once the debugging session starts, click the red stop button

#. Build the Stack Library project.

    - Set the Stack Library project as the active project.
    - Select **Project** -> **Build All** to build the Stack Library project.

#. Build the Application project.

    - Set the Application project as the active project.
    - Select **Project -> Build All** to build the Application project.

#. Load the Application project (this will include the Stack Library)

    - Select **Run** -> **Debug** to download the application

.. note::
    Application projects that consume the stack in a library form will not
    have hard defined image boundaries.

    After the initial build, if the stack project is not modified, only the
    application project needs to be rebuilt.

Before beginning execution, open a terminal window with the following settings:

.. _ccs-terminal-settings-table:
.. table:: Project Zero UART Settings

    +--------------+----------------+
    | UART Param   | Default Values |

Import Project Using Workspace
------------------------------

This section describes how to open and build an existing project and references
the project\_zero project.

All of the |BLE5_STACK| workspace included in the |SDK| have an Application
project and a Stack Library project.

In addition, applications containing the TI Over-the-Air Download (OAD) Profile
will also include the Boot Image Manager (BIM) project. For more
information on the TI OAD Profile and the BIM see the OAD Chapter of the
BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

.. error::
    If you have imported the global
    ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``
    as described in :ref:`sec-importing-tidrivers-iar-projects`,
    then |BLE5_STACK| examples will fail to build. For |BLE5_STACK| examples,
    you must remove this custom_argvars file from your IAR global custom
    arguments.

#. Open the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE from the Start Menu.
#. Open an IAR workspace project: **File** -> **Open** -> **Workspace...**

Running the Demo
================

After hitting the play button, your terminal window should display the Project
Zero initialization information as shown below:

    .. _fig-ble5_pz_terminal_initialization:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5_pz_terminal_initialization.png
        :align: center

        Project Zero Initialization

This provides information about the services present in Project Zero. Project
Zero has 4 interactive services: the LED service, the button service, the data
service, and the OAD service.

Writing a non-zero value to the LED service will cause the LEDs on the LaunchPad
to light up. Writing zero will turn them off. Enabling notifications on the
Button service will cause the Peripheral to send notifications of current button
state (0 - not pressed, 1 - pressed) to the Central device. The Data service can
be used to read and write multiple bytes of data. The OAD service can be used
for updating the image currently running on the LaunchPad.

Choose the Central device from the list below to connect with:

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        **Click to Expand BTool Instructions**

    **Host Test Setup**

    The easiest way to connect to Project Zero with another CC13xx/26xx
    LaunchPad is by using BTool. BTool allows you to send HCI commands to
    the LaunchPad to easily establish BLE communication with another device.

    To use BTool, you must flash your second |DEVBOARD| with the Host Test
    firmware from a compatible version of the TI BLE-Stack/BLE5-Stack.
    Pre-built Host Test binaries are included in the ble5stack examples
    directory of the SDK.

    Uniflash can be used to program the LaunchPad with the Host Test firmware:

    .. _fig-ble5-uniflash-host-test:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/ble5-uniflash-host-test.png
        :align: center

        Flash Host Test using Uniflash

    Open BTool from the tools\ble5stack\btool folder of the SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR.
    Select the XDS110 UART COM Port for your Host Test LaunchPad:

    .. _fig-btool_serial_port:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool_serial_port.png
        :align: center

        BTool Serial Port Settings

    When BTool connects to the LaunchPad, it will issue several initialization
    commands. If the commands succeed, you will receive multiple HCI Events with
    a Status of "SUCCESS".

    **Connect to Project Zero**

    Scan for nearby advertising Bluetooth devices by selecting the Scan button
    in the Discovery window. Make sure your Project Zero LaunchPad is
    connected to power and advertising.

    Compare the device addresses in the Slave BDA dropdown with the address
    shown in the Project Zero terminal window. Select the matching address and
    click "Establish" to connect to Project Zero.

    .. _fig-btool-scan-connect:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool-scan-connect.png
        :align: center

        Scanning & Connecting with BTool

    After the connection has established, discover & read the current value of
    the services and characteristics available on Project Zero by right-clicking
    on the Handle in the Connection Info section and selecting Read Values.

    .. _fig-btool-read-values:
    .. figure:: resources/ble5/btool-read-values.png

        :align: center

        Turning on Project Zero LEDs

    **Using the Button Service**

    You can choose to receive notifications about the current state of the
    Project Zero Button Service by writing 01:00 to the Client Characteristic
    Configuration Descriptors of the Button Service. After enabling
    notifications, the current value of the Button state will be displayed in
    BTool.

    **Using the Data Service**

    You can read and write multiple bytes of data by using the Data Service.
    Double click on the Value field of the String Char. You can write the new
    value directly in ASCII or you can choose a different type by selecting from
    the Value Type dropdown menu.

        :align: center

        Data Service Value change

    **Using the OAD Service**

    Project Zero includes the TI OAD Profile which allows you to download new
    firmware images over-the-air. Images must be compatible with the |DEVICE|
    and contain the TI OAD Profile in order to be downloaded successfully. For
    more information on creating a new image for OAD, please see the OAD Chapter
    of the BLE5-Stack User's Guide.

    .. note::
        If Project Zero was not the first image containing the TI OAD Profile you
        flashed on your LaunchPad Out-of-the-Box, the factory image in your
        external flash may not be Project Zero. This could mean that you will be
        unable to return to Project Zero by using the factory reset option after
        performing an OAD and will have to use the debugger to load a new image.

        Refer to the Project Zero readme for more information about this project
        and resetting the factory image contained in external flash.

    In BTool, choose Over The Air Download in the "Select Device Operation" box.
    In this demo, we will use Project Zero as our example since a valid image
    was created during the build process.

    Select the new image to load on your |DEVBOARD| by clicking ``Read Image
    File``. Navigate to your Project Zero build output directory. Select the
    ``*_oad.bin`` file. The ``*_oad.bin`` file will contain a valid image header.

    BTool will send a connection parameter update at the
    beginning of an OAD to attempt a faster download. The embedded application
    will also attempt a parameter update (if enabled). It is recommended to wait
    until the application's connection parameter update has taken place before
    starting an OAD. If you are experiencing a slow OAD, this may be the cause.
    The parameter update is complete once the following message is shown in the
    BTool log:

    .. code-block:: none

    Once you are sure this is the image you want to run, click Send to begin
    the OAD process.

    The Status bar will provide information on the current
    status of the download. If the download completes successfully, you will
    receive a "OAD Download Successful" message in BTool.

    .. note::
        After an OAD has completed, you may need to manually hit the reset
        button on the |DEVBOARD| in order to trigger a full reset and jump to
        BIM. This step is only required after first programming the device.

        This will disconnect the debugger and terminate the debugging section.

    reconnecting to Project Zero using the Sensor View. Select FW Download (Enhanced)
    to use the TI OAD Profile to download a new image to your LaunchPad
    Over-the-Air.

    .. note::
        If Project Zero was not the first image containing the TI OAD Profile you
        flashed on your LaunchPad Out-of-the-Box, the factory image in your
        external flash may not be Project Zero. This could mean that you will be
        unable to return to Project Zero by using the factory reset option after
        performing an OAD and will have to use the debugger to load a new image.

        Refer to the Project Zero readme for more information about this project and
        resetting the factory image contained in external flash.

    Select a new image to load on your |DEVBOARD| by pressing ``Select FW File``.
    This will display a selection of available firmware images. To select a new
    BLE5-Stack image, choose either Project Zero or Simple BLE Peripheral, then
    select ``Start OAD``. To select a new image for a different wireless technology,
    choose the firmware image of choice, select ``Start OAD`` and skip to the
    applicable Running the Demo section of the Quick Start Guide.

    After selecting ``Start OAD``, the SimpleLink Starter app will display download

    **Using the Data Service**

    The Data Service is not displayed in Sensor View. To use the Data Service,
    you will need to switch to the Service Explorer view. Tap Service Explorer
    in the top right of the screen to switch views. The Data Service is the
    service with the UUID that begins with F0001130 (Project Zero Stream
    Service). Tap the item and you will see two characteristics. The first
    characteristic can be used to read and write multiple bytes of data. You can
    do this by pressing Read characteristic to get data from ProjectZero and
    Write w/response characteristic to send multiple bytes of data to
    ProjectZero.

            Writing to the Data Service

    **Using the OAD Service**

    Return to the Sensor View by returning to the main SensorTag view and
    reconnecting to Project Zero using the Sensor View. Select FW Download (Enhanced)
    to use the TI OAD Profile to download a new image to your LaunchPad
    Over-the-Air.

    .. note::
        If Project Zero was not the first image containing the TI OAD Profile you
        flashed on your LaunchPad Out-of-the-Box, the factory image in your
        external flash may not be Project Zero. This could mean that you will be
        unable to return to Project Zero by using the factory reset option after
        performing an OAD and will have to use the debugger to load a new image.

        Refer to the Project Zero readme for more information about this project and
        resetting the factory image contained in external flash.

    Select a new image to load on your |DEVBOARD| by pressing ``Select FW File``.
    This will display a selection of available firmware images. To select a new
    BLE5-Stack image, choose either Project Zero or Simple BLE Peripheral, then
    select ``Start OAD``. To select a new image for a different wireless technology,
    choose the firmware image of choice, select ``Start OAD`` and skip to the
    applicable Running the Demo section of the Quick Start Guide.

    After selecting ``Start OAD``, the SimpleLink Starter app will display download
