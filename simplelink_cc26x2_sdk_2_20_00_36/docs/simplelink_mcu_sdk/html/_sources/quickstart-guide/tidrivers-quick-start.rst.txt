TI Drivers Quick Start
**********************

The TI Drivers interface contain the APIs, data structures and macros that the
application uses. These interfaces are the same for all SimpleLink Devices.

This section describes how to import and build an existing project and
references the TI Drivers ``empty`` project. All of TI Drivers projects included
in the development kit have a similar structure.

The TI Drivers component of the |SDK| provides no RTOS, TI-RTOS and FreeRTOS
based examples. TI-RTOS and FreeRTOS examples have the word “tirtos” or
“freertos” in the project name.

Every RTOS example has a README.html that details the Example Application Design
Details and how each example works. This feature will soon be added to the No
RTOS based examples. The README.html can be viewed in Resource Explorer on
dev.ti.com/tirex or as shown below in CCS:

Using TI Drivers Projects with CCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing TI-RTOS and FreeRTOS examples will also import kernel projects in the
same workspace. The kernel project is a dependent project and will be
automatically built when the example is built. For more details and how change
configurations look at the SimpleLink |DEVICE| SDK User’s Guide.


Import Project Using Resource Explorer
**************************************

A quick and easy way to start working with the SDK is to use the TI Resource
Explorer on dev.ti.com/tirex. Step by step instructions are available here.

Import Project Using Import Wizard
**********************************

1. Open CCS
2. Choose Project -> Import CCS Projects from the menu.
3. Select the Browse button in the Import CCS Projects dialog and select the
   directory ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/examples``

    .. _fig-ccs-import-wizard:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/ccs-import-wizard.jpg
        :align: center

        CCS Import Wizard

   CCS discovers both CCS and GCC based examples.
4. Select the TI Drivers Example Project you would like to use. In this example,
   ``empty_CC26X2_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs`` is chosen but the import and build
   instructions apply to any TI Drivers CCS example project in the |SDK|. Click
   Finish to import the ``empty`` project and its associated kernel project.

Build and Download Project
**************************

Optional: If you wish to use FreeRTOS, you must specify the location of the
FreeRTOS installation.

.. _sec-importing-tidrivers-iar-projects:

Using TI Drivers Projects with IAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using RTOS based Projects in IAR, note that the RTOS(kernel) build is a
dependent project which is automatically pre-built before the example project
builds.

The RTOS kernel(TI-RTOS or FreeRTOS build) project is linked to the workspace
but the Example Project is copied into the workspace. So the RTOS kernel needs
to be built only once within the scope of the SDK but each workspace has its own
copy of the example project.

For noRTOS Projects - There is not RTOS(kernel) build dependent project imported
into the workspace

Before starting to work with any of the TI Drivers projects in the SDK, you need
to load a set of variables that will be set for your current workspace.

1. Select Tools -> Configure Custom Argument Variables

    .. _fig-iar-configure-argvars:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/iar-configure-argvars.png
        :align: center

        Configure Custom Argument Variables

2. Select the Global tab, then click Import..

    .. _fig-iar-import-argvars:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/iar-import-argvars.png
        :align: center

        Import Global Argument Variables

3. Import the custom argvars from the SDK. The argvars are stored in a
SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars file, which is located in the
tools/iar directory of the SDK
(``<SDK_INSTALL_PATH>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``)

    .. _fig-iar-custom-argvars:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/iar-custom-argvars.png
        :align: center

        Custom Argvars Location

4. You can open
(``<SDK_INSTALL_PATH>/tools/iar/SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK.custom_argvars``)
in a text editor if you need to modify the default path argument variables.

    .. _fig-iar-default-argvars:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/iar-default-argvars.png
        :align: center

        Default Path Argument Variables

5. Restart IAR

Import Project Using Workspace
******************************

.. _sec-importing-tidrivers-makefile-projects:

Using TI Drivers Projects with Makefile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SDK examples and RTOS configuration projects ship Makefiles in addition to
IDE specific projects.

Update imports.mak
******************

.. note::
    If you have installed any tools outside of the default install path, update
    the top level ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/imports.mak`` to point to the actual
    install locations on your machine


Build Project
*************
If you are using an RTOS based example, the RTOS config must be built first. The
makefile for RTOS config are available in

``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\kernel\<tirtos/freertos>\builds\<DEVKIT>\<debug/release>\<ccs/gcc/iar>``

For example: ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\kernel\tirtos\builds\<DEVKIT>\debug\gcc\makefile``

1. Identify and build makefile for kernel project

Navigate to the kernel project makefile directory and call the gmake.exe from
the supported version of xdctools as shown below:

    .. _fig-makefile-kernel-build:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/makefile-kernel-build.png
        :align: center

        Make Kernel Project

2. Identify and build makefile for ``empty`` project
Navigate to the directory that contains the makefile for the project you wish
to build. The TI Drivers project makefiles are configured to use the Release
kernel configuration by default. If you want to use the debug kernel build,
edit the makefile as shown below:

    .. _fig-makefile-change-kernel:
    .. figure:: resources/tidrivers/makefile-change-kernel.png
        :align: center

        Edit makefile to use Debug Kernel

Continue on to the Running the Demo section for more information on the project.

Running the Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``empty`` example lights Board_GPIO_LED0 as part of the initialization in
the mainThread(). This thread then toggles the LED at a rate determined by the
arg0 parameter.

Modify the toggle rate by changing the ``time`` variable. The LED will blink at
a faster or slower rate depending on the value used.

users from beginners to experienced developers to learn about the SimpleLink MCU
Platform.

SimpleLink Academy contains modules written to demonstrate the rich debug
environment and peripheral driver capability provided by TI-RTOS.

-  **TI-RTOS Kernel Workshop** `www.training.ti.com/ti-rtos-kernel-workshop <https://training.ti.com/ti-rtos-workshop-series>`_

This material teaches users who are new to TI-RTOS or any RTOS
programming in general about TI’s RTOS kernel implementation.

Learn how the TI-RTOS provides the most optimal power management
and design flexibly.

- **TI Drivers API Guide**

The TI Drivers API Guide should be used to help guide development and
understanding of API usage. This guide is located in the ``docs\tidrivers\``
directory of the SDK.

Developing a New TI Drivers Based User Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start with one of the example projects or empty project template shipped inside
the SDK. Each software component in the SDK comes with its own set of examples.
If your project depends on multiple TI provided software libraries, start from
the empty template then add the necessary components into your projects.

Import the empty project template to your IDE and start your
application from there. All the necessary include paths and SDK specific defines
if any are already part of the Empty Project Template

    .. _fig-tirtos-empty-template:
    .. figure:: resources/tirtos-empty-template.png
        :align: center

        TIRTOS Based Empty Project Template

.. attention::

    Do not use the ``Rename`` option found inside CCS to rename your project.
    This may change certain build parameters and not others, which can lead to
    build errors and is irreversible.

    To rename a project, you should use the ``Copy`` and ``paste`` options found
    inside CCS. As you ``Paste`` the project, you have the option of choosing a
    new project name. This process is to be repeated for the target project and
    its dependencies.

    After pasting both project, you need to modify the target project's
    properties and update its "Project Reference" (need to show advanced
    settings) to only select newly pasted dependency project.
