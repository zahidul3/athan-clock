BLE-Stack OAD Profile
=====================

The TI OAD Profile has been designed to provide a simple and customizable.
In its most basic form, for both on-chip and off-chip OAD, this profile is
responsible for accepting an OAD interaction based on image header criteria,
storing the image onto the flash, and causing a device reset if the download is
successful so that the downloaded application image is run by the BIM.
The OAD distributor and OAD target perform the GATT client role and server role
respectively. The TI OAD Profile consists of two services:

    - OAD Service
    - OAD Reset Service. (used for on-chip OAD only)

Over the Air Message Sequence
-----------------------------

The following section details the over the interaction between the target and
distributor. See the following sections for description of the individual
messages and how to decode them.

OAD Service (0xFFC0)
--------------------

The OAD service is responsible for accepting/rejecting an OAD interaction based
on image header criteria, storing the image in its appropriate location, and
causing a device jump to the newly downloaded user application if the download
is successful so that the downloaded application image can be run by the
BIM.

A screenshot of BTool displaying the OAD service is shown below:

    +----------+------------------+---------------------------------------------+

The primary method for sending data from the OAD distributor to the OAD
target is the GATT writes with no response message with the exception of the
image identify message. This reduces code size and increases data throughput as
much as possible. Using GATT Notifications would require adding the
GATT_ClientInit() call. However, in a noisy or otherwise poor
RF-environment, the “write with no response” GATT message may not be sufficient
to successfully transmit an entire image and software driven timeouts and
retries may need to be added.

The primary method for sending data from the OAD target to the
OAD distributor is GATT notifications since the GATT_Client will have
already been initialized.

.. note::
    Both GATT notifications and GATT write without response are
    non-acknowledged message types. To ensure reliability, it is recommended to
    limit OAD payload transfers to one procedure per connection event.

You can refer to the :ref:`fig-oad-state-machine` for an overview of the OAD
verification and image download process.

..
    For a message sequence chart describing the OAD process in terms OAD
    service messages exchanged between the target and OAD distributor please
    see :numref:`fig-oad-sequence-diagram`.

.. _sect-oad-img-identify:

OAD Image Identify (0xFFC1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Image Identify characteristic is used to exchange image header information
between OAD distributor and target. The OAD process begins when the
OAD distributor sends the image header information of the proposed OAD
image to the target. The target will determine whether or not the proposed image
should be downloaded based on the following fields from the image header for the
candidate image. Note that a GATT long write was selected for this
procedure because the entire image ID message will not fit in a single
write no response packet for MTU < 25.

Image Identify Payload (fields must be in the following order):
    - OAD Image Identification Value
    - BIM Version
    - Image Header Version
    - Image Information
    - Image Length
    - Software Version
    - (Optional) Security Header + Security payload

The Security Header and payload are defined as:

    - Security Version
    - Timestamp
    - Signer information
    - Signature

The fields of the security header are described in more detail in
:ref:`sec-oad-security-seg`. If using a non secure application/BIM configuration
the security header/segment will not be sent.

See :ref:`sec-oad-image-header` for more information about each field.

“01:00” shall be written to the :term:`CCCD` of this characteristic
so that notification for image header rejection is enabled.

If the target accepts the image it will continue the OAD process as seen in
:ref:`oad-process`. The successful image identify will be notified with response
code  'SUCCESS'. Otherwise the target returns the error code.  The “01:00” shall
be written to the CCCD of this characteristic to enable the notification. The
error codes are listed in :ref:`sec-oad-error-codes`.

A successful OAD initiation is shown in below:

.. _fig-oad-initiation-sniffer-capture:
.. figure:: ./resources/image5.png
    :align: center

    Successful OAD Initiation Sniffer Capture

OAD Image Block Characteristic (0xFFC2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD Image Block characteristic is used to request and transfer a block of
data of an OAD Image. “01:00” shall be written to the :term:`CCCD` of this
characteristic to enable the notification for block write. The target requests
the next block of the image by sending a GATT notification to the OAD
distributor with the requested block number from the OAD Control Point
characteristic.  The OAD distributor will respond (GATT write, no response)
with the block number and the OAD image block. The image block contains the
actual binary data from the OAD image offset by the block number multiplied by
the size of a block. The OAD distributor shall get the block size from target
device by issuing the ‘Get OAD Block Size command’ to the OAD Control Point
characteristic described in :ref:`sec-oad-control-point-characteristic`.

:numref:`fig-block-request-response-sniffer-capture` shows a
block request/response sniffer capture.

    :align: center

    Block Request/Response Sniffer Capture

In :numref:`fig-block-request-response-sniffer-capture` above, the Image Block
Write Char Response is shown in gray (0x12), status of last block is shown in
teal (0x00 = "SUCCESS"), block number field is 4 bytes (little endian) and
highlighted in red. The OAD image block highlighted in purple.

.. _sec-oad-control-point-characteristic:

OAD Control Point Characteristic (0xFFC5)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD control characteristic is written with the intent of extending the TI
OAD Profile by adding a characteristic that can handle multiple commands.
Commands are sent unidirectionally from the OAD Distributor application to the
target using GATT Write No Response. The target will send command status and
return values back to the OAD distributor using GATT Notifications. If the
target doesn't support a command it shall respond with OAD_EXT_NOT_SUPPORTED,
sent as a single byte notification on the OAD Control Char with value 0xFF.
0xFF is defined as a reserved command ID. If target receives any of the control
commands without receiving 'Image Identify' it will return 'OAD_AUTH_FAIL'.

Below is the list of commands that are supported by the OAD Control Point
Characteristic:

Get OAD Block Size CMD/RSP
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Get OAD block size command is used to return the active OAD block size. The
OAD block size is always set by the target (CC26xx) device based on the
negotiated MTU size. For optimal throughput, the distributor shall perform an
MTU exchange and wait for the exchange to complete before issuing this command.

The block size is returned in the Get OAD Block Size RSP as a 16-bit value.

See :ref:`sec-blk-size-rules` for restrictions on block size.


Set Image Count CMD/RSP
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The off-chip OAD solution can be used to download more than one image in one OAD
session. The ‘OAD Image Count’ control command will be used to set the number of
OAD images to be downloaded. In the earlier version of the OAD profile, ‘OAD
Image Count’ characteristic; was used to serve this purpose. This command is not
valid for on-chip OAD and will be ignored if received. Because of flash size
limitation, on-chip OAD only supports one image download per session.
The default value of the image count is '1'.

Start OAD CMD/RSP
"""""""""""""""""

After receiving the successful  'Image Identify' response from the target
device, the OAD Distributor can start the OAD by issuing the ‘Start OAD’ command.

Enable OAD Image CMD/RSP
""""""""""""""""""""""""

As mentioned earlier, off-chip upgrade can download multiple images. The
distributor can select the image to that needs to be enabled using this control
command. After successfully downloading the new image, the OAD Distributor can
select one of the downloaded images to be enabled by issuing the ‘Enable OAD
Image’ command at OAD control point. The command either have payload bytes,
indicating the image ID,( and optionally image number and wireless tech type,
if supported) it wants to enable or no payload at all. The format of the payload
is shown in table 11. By default, the command will have no payload, and the
target device will enable the last downloaded image. The control point will send
the two-byte(command ID + return status) response notification indicating
success or fail reason.

Cancel OAD CMD/RSP
""""""""""""""""""

The OAD Distributor can cancel the image download any point during the download
process by issuing the ‘Cancel OAD’ command. The control point will send the
two-byte(command ID + return status) response notification indicating success or
reason of the failure.

Disable OAD Image Block Write CMD/RSP
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By the default, OAD target application sends notifications for each ‘Block
write’ message by sending notification via ‘OAD control point’ characteristic.
This can be overhead for the OAD process overall and can impact the battery
life. The distributor application can disable the notifications via this
command.

Get Software Version CMD/RSP
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Used to return the command ID +  4-byte long software version of the active
image.

Get OAD Image Status CMD/RSP
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reports various failures that may occur during the OAD process in one byte long
response. Error codes can be see in :ref:`sec-oad-error-codes`

Get Profile Version CMD/RSP
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The command will return two-byte(command ID + profile) long OAD profile version
supported by the application.

Get Device Type CMD/RSP
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The command will return the command ID + 4-byte device ID register.

Image Block Write Char RSP
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The OAD target will respond with notification with status and block number of
the next requested payload block from the Control Point characteristic.
The return status codes are listed in :ref:`sec-oad-error-codes`. If the
download of the entire image is complete, the OAD target device will respond
with status code OAD_DL_COMPLETE and Block number set to 0xFFFFFFFF to indicate
the download completion.

Erase All Bonds REQ/RSP
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Target device will erase all bond records from non-volatile memory.

.. _oad-reset-service:

OAD Reset Service (0xFFD0)
--------------------------

The OAD reset service is only used by on-chip OAD solutions. It
implements a method for switching/invalidating the currently running image and
resetting the device. This must occur because in on-chip solutions the currently
running image cannot update itself. More information about the
on-chip OAD process will be covered in the on-chip OAD chapter.
:numref:`fig-oad-reset-service` shows an overview of the OAD reset service and
its characteristics. Like the OAD service, the reset service uses the 128 bit TI
base UUID with a 16 bit short UUID of 0xFFD0.

    OAD Reset Service

OAD Start/Reset Characteristic (0xFFD1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OAD Start/Reset Characteristic is responsible for starting the OAD process
or resetting the target device. The size of the characteristic payload can vary
between 1 byte and many depending on if security is enabled.


The reset command is a 1 byte field as described below:

 - 0x01: Start OAD process, reset device, and boot into persistent app
 - 0x00: Reset device, and boot into user application.

The security payload is identical to the payload that is described in
:ref:`sect-oad-img-identify`. If the security payload is present the device
will only reset if the command is from a known peer. Secure versions of
the application/BIM require that the security is present.

.. _sec-blk-size-rules:

OAD Block Size Rules
--------------------

The distributor device must use the block size returned by 'Get OAD Block Size
RSP' throughout the OAD process. Once the OAD process starts, the block size
must not change. The OAD target device will select the block size as the largest
multiple of 4B that fits into the negotiated MTU size. The acceptable range of
OAD block sizes is [20, 244].
