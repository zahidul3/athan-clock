BIM for On-Chip OAD (Split Image)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the behavior of the BIM for on-chip OAD where the
the split image approach is used. This approach requires the application and
protocol stack to be separately executable images. As with off-chip OAD, it is
BIM's responsibility to locate which image should be run. In an on-chip OAD
system there are only two image types that can be executed safely:

 - Persistent application (0x00): Permanently resident application that
   implements OAD profile
 - User application (0x01): OAD upgradeable application that implements OAD
   reset service and user functionality

For more information about OAD image types, refer to the
:ref:`sec-oad-image-header` section of this chapter. The roles and
responsibilities of each application in an on-chip system is defined in the
:ref:`oad-process` section.

In summary, the applications are responsible for storing a candidate image in
internal flash, performing all OAD procedures and protocols, setting the BIM
variable, and resetting the device when appropriate. The BIM variable is a
shared RAM variable that allows the application to indicate which image should
be selected by the BIM before resetting. This is described in
:ref:`sect-ram-argument`.

Based on the BIM var and the fields in the image header, the BIM will decide
which image is most fit to run. The following will
describe the process by which the BIM selects an image.

    Functional Overview of On-chip BIM (split image)

The image above is described in words below. In order to determine which
image is best to run, BIM takes the following measures:

    1. At startup, the BIM checks the BIM variable and sets active flash page or
        image type based on :ref:`sect-ram-argument`. If BIM variable is unset
        it will default to flash page of 0 and image type of user application.

    2. BIM checks to make sure the max search iterations have not been exceeded

    3. BIM looks for a valid image header in internal flash by reading the first
       8 bytes to find the valid image Identification value.

        - If a valid image header is found, BIM will read the entire image
          header
        - If a header is not found, increment the flash page and search again
          (jump to step #2)

    4. Checks that the header and BIM version are compatible with the current
       BIM

        - Also checks that the if the image needs copy, it must be a stack image.
        - If this check fails, increase the flash page number and search again
          (jump to step #2). If user application, change image type to
          persistent application before searching again

    5. If a CRC has not been calculated on the image, calculate one and update
       CRC status field.

        - If pending copy (stack image), do not update the CRC field yet, this
          will be done after copy

    6. Check for security. (if not persistent application)

        - Ensure image is from a trusted peer by running ECDSA sign/verify
          algorithm on the image.
        - If security check fails, increment the flash page and search again
          (jump to step #2)

    7. Check if the image needs to be copied (stack image)

        - Copy image, calculate CRC to ensure copy succeeded. Update copy status
          and CRC status fields accordingly.
        - If succeeded, set image type to persistent application and set flash
          page number to 0.
        - If failed, continue searching.

    8. Continue this process until an image is found or the max iterations is
       performed.

        - If a valid image is found, jump to it
        - If no valid image is found and the max iterations have been performed,
          go to low power mode.


.. note::

    The execution flow described by the text and diagrams above is assuming
    security is on. If using an unsecured BIM configuration, the process is the
    same with the exception that there is no check for security.


.. _sect-ram-argument:

Application Execution switching using RAM
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
On devices which have RAM retention capability between resets, execution
switching between application can be done using RAM variables.
For example, on the |DEVICE|, execution switching between User and Persistent
Applications will be done by writing to a RAM variable stored at
a known RAM location. This location will be used explicitly for application
switching only. The value will be retained between resets.


The RAM variable called 'BIM Argument' is two bytes long with values as defined
in :ref:`tbl-bim-argument`. The byte 0 value defines the meaning of
the byte 1 content. In |SDK|, there are two valid values for byte 0: '0' and '1'.
Values 2-255 are reserved for future use. If BIM encounters a byte0 value
greater than 1, it will consider if invalid, will try to find the
default application starting from flash page '0', by reading image header.
