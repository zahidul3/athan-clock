Flash Layout for Off-Chip OAD
=============================

This section will describe the method for placing placing images in internal and
external flash when using off-chip OAD.

Internal flash refers to the flash memory inside the |DEVICE| and external
flash refers to an external SPI flash memory connected to the |DEVICE| via SPI.

See requirements below for off-chip OAD.

Constraints and Requirements for Off-chip OAD
---------------------------------------------

In order to perform an Off-chip OAD the target system must have:

  - An off-chip flash storage as large as the application size + one
    external flash page to store the external flash image header. (default example
    will use 1MB of external flash)
  - A serial connection (SPI) is used to communicate with the off-chip flash
    component.
  - Free GPIO pins to interface to the external memory (i.e. 4 wires for SPI)
  - Enough free code space to reserve the entire contents of the last 1-2 flash
    page(s) for BIM

.. _sect-off-chip-bim-memory-layout:

Internal Flash Memory Layout
----------------------------

The internal flash of the device contains the active user application and the
BIM. Off-chip OAD maximizes the available flash space to the user
application because of its ability to store the incoming image in external flash
during the download process.

.. note::

    When using security the BIM may use a second page depending on the
    page size of the device. Consult the BIM's linker file for more information.

The user application pictured above is responsible for the following:

    - Implementing the protocol stack specific implementation of the OAD
      transport
    - Finding a suitable location in external flash for the image and storing
      its image header in the table.

.. _sec-ext-flash-layout:

External Flash Memory Layout
----------------------------

The off-chip flash memory on the |DEVBOARD| contains the image header vector
table and the user applications. The memory map layout of the external flash
part is defined in :code:`ext_flash_layout.h`.
The amount of space reserved for each application is dynamically\* sized by the
user application's implementation of the OAD protocol. The size of the image in
external flash can be determined once the image header vector is sent over the
air.

The application will round up as necessary according to the equation below:

.. math::

  \textrm{numExtFlashPages} = \frac{imageLen}{EFL\_PAGE\_SIZE} + imageLen \bmod EFL\_PAGE\_SIZE


The memory partition of the application for Off-chip OAD is depicted in
below.

The size of the image header table is scalable and can be changed in the
user application implementation of the OAD protocol.

.. note::

  The CC2640R2 SDK applications take a simplistic approach to external flash
  layout, partioning the variable space in external flash into two sectors

   - Sector 0: used for all app images and is 128kB
     (matching device size for CC2640R2)
   - Sector 1: used for app+stack and other image types, also 128kB
   - The max number of metadata is capped at 4.

  Other definitons can be found in ``ext_flash_layout.h``.


Each entry to the image header table contains a pointer to it's associated image
location in external flash as shown below.

.. warning::

    The convention is that image header sector 0 is reserved for the
    :term:`Factory Image`. This region should be reserved for known good images
    as the BIM will revert to the factory image if there are no
    acceptable images in internal or external flash (user section).
