Clocks
------

Clock instances are functions that can be scheduled to run after a certain
number of system ticks. Clock instances are either one-shot or periodic. These
instances start immediately upon creation, are configured to start after a
delay, and can be stopped at any time. All clock instances are executed when
they expire in the context of a :term:`Swi`. The following example shows the
minimum resolution is the TI-RTOS clock tick period set in the TI-RTOS
configuration file (``.cfg``).

.. note::
    The default TI-RTOS kernel tick period is 1 millisecond. For |DEVICE|
    devices, this is reconfigured in the TI-RTOS configuration file (``.cfg``)::

        Clock.tickPeriod = 10;

Each system tick, which is derived from the real-time clock :term:`RTC`,
launches a Clock object that compares the running tick count with the period of
each clock to determine if the associated function should run. For
higher-resolution timers, TI recommends using a 16-bit hardware timer channel
or the sensor controller. See the Clock module in the package ti.sysbios.knl
section of the `TI-RTOS Kernel User Guide`_ for more information on these
functions.

            The Clock object invokes supplied function pointer.

    group Process period function and restart Clock object
        -> A : Unblocked due to posted APP_PERIODIC_EVT.
        activate A
        rnote over A
            Given that an event was posted, we can process the
            periodic function from a Task context.
        end note
        autonumber resume
        A -> A : Application_performPeriodicTask()
        activate A

        rnote over A
            Restart the clock after the periodic process
        end note
        deactivate A
        autonumber stop
        A -> B : Clock_start();
        B --> A

        deactivate A
        note left: Event_pend(event,...)
    end

    rnote over A, B
        The Clock object will trigger after
        expiration and the cycle will repeat itself.
    end note

**Step 1** in :ref:`fig-periodic-clock` constructs the Clock object using the
``Clock_construct`` API. When the application desires, it will then start the
Clock object via the ``Clock_start()`` API.

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Constructing ``periodicClock`` Clock object
    :emphasize-lines: 2,5-6

    // Clock instances for internal periodic events.
    static Clock_Struct periodicClock;

    // Create one-shot clocks for internal periodic events.
    Clock_construct(&periodicClock, Application_clockHandler,
        APP_PERIODIC_EVT_PERIOD, 0, false, APP_PERIODIC_EVT);

**Step 2** in :ref:`fig-periodic-clock`, after the Clock object's timer expired,
it will execute ``Application_clockHandler()`` within a Swi context. As this
call cannot be blocked and blocks all Tasks, it is kept short by invoking an
``Event_post(APP_PERIODIC_EVT)`` for post processing in the application task.

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Defining Application_clockHandler()
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    static void Application_clockHandler(UArg arg)
    {
        /* arg is passed in from Clock_construct() */
        Event_post(events, arg);
    }

.. attention::
    Clock functions must not call blocking kernel APIs or TI-RTOS driver APIs!
    Executing long routines will impact real-time constraints placed in high
    priority tasks allocated for wireless protocol stacks!

**Step 3** in :ref:`fig-periodic-clock`, the application task is
unblocked due the ``Event_post(APP_PERIODIC_EVT)``, where it proceeds to invoke
the ``Application_performPeriodicTask()`` function. Afterwards, to
restart the periodic execution of this function, it will restart the
``periodicClock`` Clock object.

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Servicing the APP_PERIODIC_EVT event
    :emphasize-lines: 4, 7

    if (events & APP_PERIODIC_EVT)
    {
      // Perform periodic application task
      Application_performPeriodicTask();
      
      Clock_Handle hClock = Clock_handle(&periodicClock);
      Clock_start(hClock);
    }
