Kernel Configuration
--------------------

A TI-RTOS application configures the TI-RTOS kernel using a configuration
(``.cfg`` file) that is found within the project. In :term:`IAR` and
:term:`CCS` projects, this file is found in the application project workspace
under the ``TOOLS`` folder.

The configuration is accomplished by selectively including or *using*
:term:`RTSC` modules available to the kernel. To *use* a module, the ``.cfg``
calls ``xdc.useModule()`` after which it can set various options as defined in
the `TI-RTOS Kernel User Guide`_.

Some of the option that can be configured in the ``.cfg`` file include but are
not limited to:

- Boot options

- Number of Hwi, Swi, and Task priorities

- Exception and Error handling

- The duration of a System tick (the most fundamental *unit* of time in the
  TI-RTOS kernel).

- Defining the application's entry point and interrupt vector

- TI-RTOS heaps and stacks

- Including pre-compiled kernel and TI-RTOS driver libraries

- System providers (for ``System_printf()``)

Whenever a change in the ``.cfg`` file is made, you will rerun the XDCTools'
``configuro`` tool. This step is already handled for you as a pre-build step in
the provided :term:`IAR` and :term:`CCS` examples.

For the |DEVICE|, a TI-RTOS kernel exists in :term:`ROM`. Typically for flash
footprint savings, the ``.cfg`` will include the kernel's :term:`ROM` module as
shown in :numref:`rom-listing`

    :emphasize-lines: 5,7,10

    /* ================ ROM configuration ================ */
    /*
     * To use BIOS in flash, comment out the code block below.
     */
    var ROM = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.rom.ROM');
    if (Program.cpu.deviceName.match(/CC26X2/)) {
        ROM.romName = ROM.CC26X2;
    }
    else if (Program.cpu.deviceName.match(/CC13X2/)) {
        ROM.romName = ROM.CC13X2;
    }

The TI-RTOS kernel in :term:`ROM` is optimized for performance. If additional
instrumentation is required in your application (typically for debugging), you
must include the TI-RTOS kernel in flash which will increase flash memory
consumption. Shown below is a short list of requirements to use the TI-RTOS
kernel in :term:`ROM`.

- ``BIOS.assertsEnabled`` **must** be set to ``false``

- ``BIOS.logsEnabled`` **must** be set to ``false``

- ``BIOS.taskEnabled`` **must** be set to ``true``

- ``BIOS.swiEnabled`` **must** be set to ``true``

- ``BIOS.runtimeCreatesEnabled`` **must** be set to ``true``

- BIOS **must** use the ``ti.sysbios.gates.GateMutex`` module

- ``Clock.tickSource`` **must** be set to ``Clock.TickSource_TIMER``

- ``Semaphore.supportsPriority`` **must** be ``false``

- Swi, Task, and Hwi hooks are **not** permitted

- Swi, Task, and Hwi name instances are **not** permitted

- Task stack checking is **disabled**

- ``Hwi.disablePriority`` **must** be set to ``0x20``

- ``Hwi.dispatcherAutoNestingSupport`` **must** be set to true

For additional documentation in regards to the list described above, see the
`TI-RTOS Kernel User Guide`_.

.. _create_vs_construct:

Creating vs. Constructing
-------------------------
Most TI-RTOS modules commonly have ``_create()`` and ``_construct()`` APIs to
initialize primitive instances. The main **runtime** differences between the
two APIs are memory allocation and error handling.

**Create** APIs perform a memory allocation from the default TI-RTOS heap
before initialization. As a result, the application *must* check the return
value for a valid handle before continuing.

.. _create-example-listing:
.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:
    :caption: Creating a Semaphore
    :emphasize-lines: 5, 7

    Semaphore_Handle sem;
    Semaphore_Params semParams;

    Semaphore_Params_init(&semParams);
    sem = Semaphore_create(0, &semParams, NULL); /* Memory allocated in here */

    if (sem == NULL) /* Check if the handle is valid */
    {
        System_abort("Semaphore could not be created");
    }

**Construct** APIs are given a data structure with which to store the
instance's variables. As the memory has been pre-allocated for the instance,
error checking may not be required after constructing.

.. _construct-example-listing:
.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:
    :caption: Constructing a Semaphore
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 6

    Semaphore_Handle sem;
    Semaphore_Params semParams;
    Semaphore_Struct structSem; /* Memory allocated at build time */

    Semaphore_Params_init(&semParams);
    Semaphore_construct(&structSem, 0, &semParams);

    /* It's optional to store the handle */
    sem = Semaphore_handle(&structSem);
