Hardware Architecture
=====================

ARM Cortex M0 (Radio Core)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Cortex M0 (CM0) core within the |DEVICE| is responsible for both interfacing
to the radio hardware, and translating complex instructions from the Cortex M3
(CM3) core into bits that are sent over the air using the radio. For the
Bluetooth low energy protocol, the CM0 implements the PHY layer of the protocol
stack. Often, the CM0 is able to operate autonomously, which frees up the CM3
for higher-level protocol and application-layer processing.

The CM3 communicates with the CM0 through a hardware interface called the RF
doorbell, which is documented in section 23.2 of the |TRM|. The radio core
firmware is not intended to be used or modified by the application developer.

ARM Cortex M4F (System Core)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system core (CM4F) is designed to run the wireless protocol stack from the
link layer up to the user application. The link layer interfaces to the radio
core through a software module called the RF driver, which sits above the RF
doorbell. The RF driver runs on the CM3 and acts as an interface to the radio on
the |DEVICE|, and also manages the power domains of the radio hardware and core.
Documentation for the RF driver can be found at
the `TI-RTOS Drivers Reference <..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.

Flash, RAM, and Peripherals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |DEVICE| contains 352KB of in-system programmable flash memory, 80KB of
SRAM, and a full range of peripherals. The flash is split into erasable pages of
8KB. The |DEVICE| also contains 8KB of cache SRAM that can be utilized to extend
RAM capacity or can function as a normal cache to increase application
performance. Other peripherals include UART, I2C, I2S, AES, TRNG, temperature
and battery monitors, 4x 32-bit timers, 2x SSI, and an itegrated and autonomous
sensor controller. See :ref:`sensor-controller` for more information on the
sensor controller.

Programming Internal Flash With the ROM Bootloader
--------------------------------------------------

The |DEVICE| internal flash memory can be programmed using the bootloader
located in device ROM. Both UART and SPI protocols are supported. See chapter 8
of the |TRM| for more details on the programming protocol and requirements.

.. note:: Because the ROM bootloader uses predefined DIO pins for internal flash
    programming, allocate these pins in the board layout. The |TRM| has more
    details on the pins allocated to the bootloader based on the chip package type.

Startup Sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a complete description of the |DEVICE| reset sequence, see the |TRM|.

.. _sec-resets:

Resets
^^^^^^

Reset the device using only hard resets. From the software, this reset can be accomplished using:

:code:`HAL_SYSTEM_RESET();`

In CCS, select Board Reset (automatic) from the reset menu (see
:numref:`fig-board-reset`).
