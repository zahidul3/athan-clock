Linux Border Router Quick Start
===============================

.. warning::
    Please note this is an alpha release, as such some items are not fully
    functional. These include commissioning and a full Border Router, and
    matching Android Thread Commissioning Application.

The focus of this tutorial is to help developers get a border router solution
that will allow a other devices to communicate with an OpenThread device using
CoAP.

This document is written for, and with the intent of using a |BBB| as the Linux
host that runs the overall border router application.

This example will also run on a Linux host such as Ubuntu 16.04.

.. note::
    This release, and this guide does not fully support the OpenThread
    Border Router, instead this tutorial makes use of the OpenThread Border
    Router Repository only for the purposes of the ``libcoap`` library and
    tools. The Border Router repository contains a copy of libcoap and the
    required patches to ``libcoap`` to make libcoap function with OpenThread.

Platform Notes
--------------

Embedded Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial focuses on using two |OT_STACK| examples with some optional extra
examples.

-  An NCP (network co-processor) device

-  A CLI (command line interface) device

-  (optional) doorlock, temperature sensor, thermostat, or shade.

The NCP example will connect to a Linux machine using a serial port. This
getting started guide assumes that you are using a |LP|, using the XDS110
built-in USB-to-serial converter.

The application on the host processor (``wpantund``) will send commands to the
NCP over UART using the Spinel protocol. These commands will configure the
OpenThread stack on the NCP, and will be used to send and receive network
traffic.
