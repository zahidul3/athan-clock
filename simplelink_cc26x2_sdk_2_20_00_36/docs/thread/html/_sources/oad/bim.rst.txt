Boot Image Manager (BIM)
========================

The Boot Image Manager resides on the OAD target, and is responsible for loading
new images after a download has completed. The BIM executes on a device reset
and determines if a firmware update needs to be applied. If no update is being
applied, then the BIM will transfer program execution to the main application
image.

Overview & Software Architecture
--------------------------------

BIM is a fully executable application that is independent of any high
level protocol stack or user application. It is guaranteed to run on boot.
BIM enables power loss fault tolerance during OAD. If the device power is lost
during OAD, the BIM will still be able to run from reset and revert to a
working image if one is available. The BIM is intended to reside permanently on
the chip and cannot be updated via the OAD process.

BIM executes before kernel initialization takes place so the design is
single threaded and bare metal. Hardware access is accomplished through
driverlib.

As a separate application, BIM requires its own interrupt vector table
and linker file. It will produce a fully executable image that must be merged
with the user application image in order to create a functional OAD enabled
firmware system.

In general, BIM is responsible for finding and analyzing OAD image header.
From a high level BIM does the following:

    1. Check for newly downloaded images from a recent OAD.

    2. If available, copy the newly downloaded images to their target location
       in internal flash

    3. Dynamically locate the entry point of the valid image and jump to it

The following section will cover the BIM boot procedure and image
checking routine in detail.

.. _sec-oad-bim-boot:

Boot procedure
--------------

On reset, the software in the ROM of the |DEVICE| will execute basic startup
routines, and then jump to the location pointed to by the :term:`CCFG`'s
``IMAGE_VALID_CONF`` field. More information about the fields of the CCFG and
the generic device boot procedure is detailed in the |TRM|. The BIM is setup to
link the CCFG as part of its image. This is another failsafe mechanism to ensure
that a CCFG is always present on the device. To enable this feature, BIM uses a
custom CCFG where the value of the ``IMAGE_VALID_CONF`` field points to BIM's
reset vector table. More information about the CCFG and the ``IMAGE_VALID_CONF``
is available in the |TRM|.

In summary, the boot ROM code will jump to the ``ResetISR()`` in BIM's
vector table. Being a bare metal application, BIM uses the toolchain
specific boot code provided in driverlib.

The reset ISR code can be found in driverlib under the ``startup`` folder. In
summary, it performs the following:

    1. Device specific trim functionality
    2. C/C++ runtime initialization
    3. Jump to BIM's ``main()``

See the figure below for a graphical representation of the boot procedure. Red
boxes indicate driverlib/ROM code, blue boxes represent BIM code.

.. _sec-oad-bim-trim:

Device trim
^^^^^^^^^^^

The device trim function is responsible for tuning hardware settings of the
device to ensure stable and optimal operation. It must run at least once every
time the device boots, but may be ran more than once. Parts of the trim function
are dependent on the CCFG which is another reason why it is linked
with BIM.

By default, both BIM and the user application will trim the device.

This offers the benefit that the user application may link to a newer version of
the trim function. This comes at the cost of a small amount of additional flash
in the user application.

.. warning::

    It is recommend to leave device trim enabled in both the BIM and the
    user application to enable development via a debugger without a BIM
    present.

Removing the device trim for the user application is only suggested for final
production code. Additional validation should be performed on images with
additional trimming disabled. App level trimming can be disabled by modifying
the Boot module within the kernel's ``*.cfg`` file.

Locating and Preparing a user application
-----------------------------------------

Besides booting and trimming the device, BIM's primary functionality is to
find and prepare a user application to run on the |DEVICE|.

.. _sec-oad-bim-offchip:

BIM for Off-Chip OAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At steady state, the normal case is that a valid image exists in internal flash
and no image in the external flash has been marked as needing to be copied. In
this case, BIM will validate that the image on internal flash and execute it
by loading the stack pointer and jumping to the image's reset vector location.
BIM determines the location of the reset vector and stack pointer of the image
through the OAD image header attached to it.

.. note::

    As a convention, the vector table comes immediately after the image header
    in OAD enabled images. The BIM and the image header are tightly coupled,
    refer to the :ref:`sec-oad-image-header` chapter for more detail on the
    image header vector and its fields.

    Functional Overview of Off-chip BIM

The image above is illustrated in words below. In order to determine which
image is best to run, BIM takes the following measures:

    1. At startup, BIM looks for a valid image header in external flash by
       reading the first 8 bytes to find the valid External Flash Image
       Identification value.

    2. After a valid header is found, it reads the entire header from ext flash
       and verifies the compatibility of BIM and image header versions. Then it
       checks if the 'Image copy status' is set to be copied to the on-chip
       flash(0xFE) and has a valid CRC (CRC status=0xFE).

        - If it finds status 'CRC not calculated'(CRC Status = 0xFF), it
          calculates the CRC of the external flash contents and updates the CRC
          status byte in the external flash.

        - On finding the invalid CRC it moves on to read the next image's
          header.

    3. If a valid image is found, BIM copies the image to on-chip flash, as per
       the image copy procedure.

        - After the copy, the CRC is re-checked on internal flash to ensure the
          copy succeeded.

        - If the copy failed the status byte is updated and the bim will
          continue searching external flash.

        - If the copy succeeded, then the BIM will jump directly to the
          application image, and the search process ends.

    5. If BIM reaches the end of the image header region in external flash
       without finding a valid image, then it will try to find an on-chip image
       and execute it.

    6. If BIM fails to find a valid image internal flash, it will attempt to
       revert the factory image if there is one present.

    7. BIM will put the device to low power mode if it fails to find a valid
       application image.

.. note::
    An image is considered bad/invalid if it's calculated CRC32 does not match
    the image's CRC bytes embedded in the image header.
