Migration Guide
===============


Migrating from TI-OpenThread 0.95.00 to 1.00.00
-----------------------------------------------

In this guide we will take the doorlock example application from a built state
in the TI-OpenThread Stack version ``0.95.00`` to working with the
TI-OpenThread Stack version ``1.00.00``. The doorlock is a :term:`MTD` example,
the migration will be very similar for :term:`FTD` projects. I am showing off
migrating a ti-cgt toolchain example (ccs), the relevant information changes
for gcc will be called out.

    Legacy 0.95.00 doorlock project


.. warning::
    The doorlock example was choosen for it's simple nature, and because it
    shows off the issues we faced porting from the previous stack to this one.
    This guide is by no means exhaustive, your application may use different
    APIs or expect different behavior.


Change the selected product
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first thing to check is that the new SimpleLink SDK is installed and that
CCS has discovered it. Open the CCS Preferences dialog by clicking ``Window``
|rarr| ``Preferences``, then navigate to the products page by selecting ``Code
Composer Studio`` |rarr| ``Products``. You should see the new SimpleLink SDK
recognized in the ``Installed products:`` pane as in
:numref:`fig-new-product-installed` If CCS has not discovered your newly
installed product you can click ``Rediscover...`` or restart CCS to have it
scan again. If CCS does not discover the new SDK, you may not have installed it
correctly.

.. note::
    Here I have installed an engineering version of the SDK, your version will
    be the released version. This will work exactly the same as the one I have
    installed.

Right click on your project in the project explorer and select ``Properties``
to open up the Properties dialog for that project. I have opened the doorlock
project's properties in :numref:`fig-select-new-product` In the Properties
dialog, navigate to the ``General`` page and select the ``Products`` tab. From
there change the selected SimpleLink SDK version to your newly installed SDK.
Once you click ``OK``, CCS will rewrite the SDK base variable from the old SDK
to the new SDK.

.. figure:: resources/fig-select-new-product.png
    :align: center

    Changing the selected SimpleLink SDK version

Repeat this process for each of the projects in your Project Explorer.

.. note::
    This will rewrite the base that the OpenThread projects use to find the
    OpenThread source code. If you have made any modification to the OpenThread
    source code you will have to manually port those changes from the old SDK
    to the new SDK.


Clean all the projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These projects were originally built with the old SDK source. We need to make
sure that no built content is accidentally left over from the old SDK. Select
``Project`` |rarr| ``Clean...`` to open the Clean dialog. Make sure that the
``Clean all projects`` radio button is selected and that the ``Start a build
immediately`` checkbox is unchecked. Then click ``OK`` to begin cleaning all
the projects in your workspace.

Build and find errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have migrated your projects to point to the new SDK root, try
building. This will most likely end in error as seen in
:numref:`fig-build-and-error` Now we've got our work cut out for us.

Posix errors
""""""""""""

Most of the errors we face on our first build are definitions of Posix headers
and types. This can be seen in :numref:`fig-posix-error`

.. _fig-posix-error:
.. figure:: resources/fig-posix-error.png
    :align: center

    Posix errors

These errors are caused by a change in how TI-RTOS treats Posix headers. This
can be seen in the Upgrade an Compatibility section of the
``simplelink_mcu_sdk`` release notes. In the TI-RTOS config file
``release.cfg`` we must change the Posix configuration.

From:

.. code-block:: js

    var Settings = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.posix.Settings');
    Settings.supportsMutexPriority = true;

To:

.. code-block:: js

    var Settings = xdc.useModule('ti.posix.tirtos.Settings');
    Settings.enableMutexPriority = true;

It is also necessary to change the Posix include paths.

From:

.. code-block:: none

    TIRTOS: <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/kernel/tirtos/packages/ti/sysbios/posix
    FreeRTOS: <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/kernel/freertos/posix

To:

.. code-block:: none

    CCS Compiler: <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/posix/ccs
    GCC Compiler: <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/posix/gcc
    IAR Compiler: <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/posix/iar

Right click on the project that uses Posix and select ``Properties`` to open up
the properties dialog. Then navigate to the Include Options page by selecting
``Build`` |rarr| ``ARM Compiler`` |rarr| ``Include Options``. Then change the
posix include path as seen in :numref:`fig-posix-include`

Deprecated OpenThread APIs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Trying to build after fixing the Posix include paths will result in the errors
seen in :numref:`fig-openthread-deprecated`

.. _fig-openthread-deprecated:
.. figure:: resources/fig-openthread-deprecated.png
    :align: center

    ``otLinkGetJoinerId`` has been removed

OpenThread removed the API to query the HashMacAddr value. This was because the
commissioning process was updated to use the EUI64 instead. For our purposes,
it is enough to remove the uses of the API; your application may need to be
updated to work around this change.

.. warning::
    These are the only APIs that were deprecated in our example applications.
    Functionality may have changed between versions of OpenThread, check the
    difference and changelog on github.com/openthread/openthread.

OpenThread config changes
-------------------------

The OpenThread configuration headers are copied into the repository, make sure
to check the difference between your workspace's configuration files and the
ones in a freshly imported project.
