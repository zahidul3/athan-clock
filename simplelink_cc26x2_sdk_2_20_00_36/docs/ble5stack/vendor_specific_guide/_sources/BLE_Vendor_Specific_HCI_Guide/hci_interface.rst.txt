HCI Interface
*************

HCI Overview
============

The HCI is a standardized Bluetooth interface for sending commands, receiving
events, and for sending and receiving data. It is typically realized as a serial
interface, using either RS232 or USB communication devices. As the name implies,
the HCI is used to bridge the Host and Controller devices. Commands and Events
can either be specified, or can be vendor specific for extensibility. The
following sections summarize the HCI protocol, the specification defined
commands and events used by BLE, and a detailed description of the vendor
specific commands and events defined by Texas Instruments Inc. For complete
details on the HCI as specified by the Special Interest Group (SIG), please
see the Core specification [1].

Specification Interface
=======================

HCI Interface Protocol
----------------------

The HCI supports four types of packets: Command Packet, Asynchronous Data
Packet, Synchronous Data Packet, and Event Packet. The packet type is a one byte
value that precedes the HCI packet. The packet type has the following values:

==================== ===========
Packet               Packet Type
==================== ===========
Command              0x01
Asynchronous Data    0x02
Synchronous Data     0x03
Event                0x04
Extended Command     0x09
==================== ===========

The contents of each packet are shown as follows (please see section 5.4 of
[1], Vol. 2, Part E for additional details).

Command Packet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The command packet is comprised of the opcode, the number of parameters, and
parameters themselves.

    Command Packet

Asynchronous Data Packet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The asynchronous data packet is comprised of the connection handle, fragmentation
bits, the number of data bytes, and the data bytes themselves.

    :align: center

    Asynchronous Data Packet

Synchronous Data Packet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This synchronous data packet is not used in BLE.

Event Packet
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The event packet is comprised of the event code, the number of event parameters,
and the event parameters themselves.

.. _event-packet:

    :align: center

    Event Packet

Extended Command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This packet is used to allow more than the HCI limit of 256 bytes. It includes a
two-byte length field which states the payload length:

============= ==================
Offset        Description
============= ==================
0             packet type (0x09)
1             LSB opcode
2             MSB opcode
3             LSB payload length
4             MSB payload length
5..(length-3) Payload
============= ==================

See each individual command for payload formatting.

HCI Commands
------------

HCI commands use a 16-bit opcode for identification. The opcode is subdivided
into two parts: a 10-bit Opcode Command Field (OCF) and a 6-bit Opcode Group
Field (OGF).

    HCI Command Opcode

The OGF values are defined by the Bluetooth (BT) Core specification. The LE
specification has its own OGF value. Also, there is an escape OGF value so that vendor specific OCF codes can be used. The following OGF values are valid for BLE:
# Link Control Commands: 1
# Link Policy Commands: 2
# Controller and Baseband Commands: 3
# Informational Parameters: 4
# Status Parameters: 5
# Testing Commands: 6
# LE Only Commands: 8
# Vendor Specific Commands: 63

The following table, Table 2, lists all specification LE HCI commands and their opcodes. Note that while all commands can be sent by the application processor to the Network Processor using HCI, not all events will be returned as they will be trapped and possibly discarded by the Host layer of the BLE Stack. Therefore, it is not possible to support an external BLE Host in the Network Processor configuration. Network Processor based designs should use the respective Vendor Extension commands detailed in the following sections to implement an off-chip application.

HCI Events
----------

HCI events use an 8-bit event code. All event codes are unique for BT and BLE.
Only event code 255 is reserved for vendor specific events. There is only one
event code for all LE events. The first event parameter is used as the subevent
code to distinguish the LE event types.

The following table lists all the BLE events and their event codes, and subevent
codes when applicable:

======================================== ==========

Vendor Specific Interface
=========================

As mentioned, vendors can specify their own HCI commands and events by using the
predefined vendor specific opcode and vendor specific event code.

Vendor Specific Commands
------------------------

A vendor specific opcode is indicated by an OGF value of 63. The vendor can use
the remaining 10 bits (i.e. the OCF) as they like. TI defines its vendor
specific OCF values by subdividing the 10 bits into a 3 MSB Command Subgroup
(CSG) and a 7 LSB Command (CMD). The CSG is used by the HCI to route the
commands to a designated subsystem within the BLE stack. In this way, vendor
specific commands can be specified for any BLE stack layer.

.. _vendor-specific-opcode-0-6:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/vendor-specific-opcode-0-6.png
    :align: center

    HCI Vendor Specific Command Opcode, CSG=0..6

The Command Subgroups are defined as follows:

=== ============
CSG Subgroup
=== ============
0   HCI
1   L2CAP
2   ATT
3   GATT
4   GAP
5   UTIL
6   Reserved
7   User Profile
=== ============

For Command Subgroups 0 to 6, the remaining 7 bits of Command provide up to 128
commands for each subgroup. For Subgroup 7, the remaining 7 bits specify one of
128 profiles and indicates that the subsequent byte is to be used as the command
for that particular profile (i.e. up to 256 commands per profile).

.. _vendor-specific-opcode-7:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/vendor-specific-opcode-7.png
    :align: center

    HCI Vendor Specific Command Opcode, CSG=7

The following table lists all TI-specific HCI commands:

.. include:: /BLE_Vendor_Specific_HCI_Guide/hci_vs_extracted_command_table.rst

Vendor Specific Events
----------------------

A vendor specific event code is indicated by a value of 255. The vendor must
then use event parameters (following the length byte) to specify vendor specific
events. TI defines the following two bytes as the Event Opcode.

.. _vendor-specific-event-1:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/vendor-specific-event-1.png
    :align: center

The Event Opcode was chosen to mirror the Command Opcode by dividing it into
two parts: a 6 bit Event Opcode Group Field (EOGF), and a 10 bit Event Opcode
Event Field (EOEF).

.. _vendor-specific-event-2:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/vendor-specific-event-2.png
    :align: center

The EOEF is again chosen to mirror the Command OCF by dividing it into two
parts: the Event Subgroup (ESG) and the Event.

.. _vendor-specific-event-3:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/vendor-specific-event-3.png
    :align: center

The EOGF is defined as follows:

==== ================
EOGF Group
==== ================
0    Embedded Opcode
1    Core Opcode
2    Profile Request
3    Profile Response
4-63 Reserved
==== ================

The ESG is defined as in Table 4. The Events are as defined in the following
table. Please note that the value of the Events cannot be less than 0x400 as the
first 1024 values are reserved. The reason for this has to do with
Client/Server Request/Response Tunneling, which is described in the following
section. Tunneling requires embedding Command Opcodes in HCI Events. When this
is done, the EOGF is zero, and the remaining 10 bits is the Command Opcode. In
order to prevent Command and Event Opcode overlap, the first 1024 values are
reserved in the Event Opcode space. Also note that the Event Code (EC) is
always 0xFF since normally only Controller events are returned via the HCI.

.. include:: /BLE_Vendor_Specific_HCI_Guide/hci_vs_extracted_event_table.rst

You will note that there are two EOGF values for Profiles. At this time, no
profiles are defined well enough to document here. These values are defined in
anticipation of not only needing large numbers of profiles and their commands,
but also of needing the direction the command is travelling when embedded in an
HCI Command or Event. You can see that ATT does not have this issue as these
commands are already defined using even values for commands and odd values for
events, and thus, direction is distinguishable. For profiles, it is not yet
known how the commands and events will be defined.

Request and Response Tunneling
------------------------------

In the Client/Server model defined and supported by the BLE stack, the Client
sends Requests to the Server and the Server sends Responses back to the Client.
The Requests sent by the Client may be handled by a Server on the same device,
or they may travel OTA to the Server on another device. Similarly, the Response
sent by the Server may be handled by a Client on the same device, or may be sent
OTA to a Client on another device from which the request came. But in either
case, as long as the Requests and Responses remain within the scope of the BLE
stack software (i.e. the BLE Server database is on the device), the BLE stack
remains unconcerned about whether the Requests and Responses are sent/received
by the same device or are from another device. Please see :numref:`tunneling-1`.

.. _tunneling-1:
.. figure:: vsg_resources/tunneling-1.png
    :align: center

    Request/Response with Server Database in BLE Stack

However, when using the Network Processor Configuration with HCI such that the
Server database is not located on the device, then Requests and Reponses have to
be mapped into HCI Commands and Events. The HCI is specified such that only
Commands are sent from the Host to the Controller, and only Events are sent from
the Controller to the Host. If the Server database is located on say a PC, then
when an OTA Request is received by the Server device, it must be sent to the PC
via the HCI. Even though the Request started out on one end as an HCI Command,
it must be provided to the remote PC as an HCI event on the other. Similarly,
when the PC sends the Response on one end, which will be an HCI Event to the
remote PC on the other, it must be sent to the device as an HCI Command. Thus,
the Request, which starts out as an HCI Command, must be embedded in an HCI
Event when received by the remote PC, and the Response, which starts out as an
HCI Command, must be embedded in an HCI Event when received by the remote PC.
In this way, Requests and Responses are being tunneled in HCI Commands and
Events. Please see :numref:`tunneling-2`.
