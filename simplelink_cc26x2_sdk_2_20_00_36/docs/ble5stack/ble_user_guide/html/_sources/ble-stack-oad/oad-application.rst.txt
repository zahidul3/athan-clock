OAD Application
===============

The application layer is responsible for plugging the OAD module. The OAD
profile and communication with the BLE-Stack is encapsulated inside the OAD
module. An application developer wishing to implement use the TI OAD solution
will not need to worry about implementing the OAD state machine, but instead can
just include the module and make the proper calls as detailed in
:ref:`sec-add-ble-oad-to-project`. However, the details of the OAD application
layer are documented here for completeness and to aide in debugging.

OAD Software Architecture
-------------------------

The building blocks of the OAD software architecture are detailed below.
In the figure below the following terms have been abbreviated for compactness in
the image.

    - CB : Callback
    - SVC: BLE Service
    - Func: Function

Internally the OAD module is responsible for the following:

    - Implementing the OAD profile
    - Plugging the GATT read and write callback from the |STACK|
    - Serializing and de-serializing structures from over the messages
    - Sending OAD related requests and responses to the |STACK| to be sent over
      the air
    - Queuing up messages from stack callbacks to be processed later by the
      application
    - Implementing the OAD state machine, and ensuring proper state transitions
    - Implementing the OAD inactivity timers
    - Implementing getter/setter functions for the application to use and
      configure the OAD module

External to the OAD module the application task is responsible for the
following. See :ref:`sec-add-ble-oad-to-project` more more information.

    - Plugging an OAD event handler
    - Calling the OAD event processing function in a task context when events
      are posted.
    - Resetting the device when the ``OAD_DL_COMPLETE`` event is received.

A message sequence chart is included below to show a sample of an application's
interaction with the OAD module.

OAD State Machine
-----------------

The OAD module implements an 'OAD State Machine' for performing the OAD. The
following state machine depicts the OAD module state transitions and its
interactions with the OAD communication profile messages for both on-chip and
off-chip OAD.

.. _fig-oad-state-machine:
.. figure:: resources/oad_state_machine.png
    :align: center

    OAD Types Overview

The states and state transitions are encapsulated inside the OAD module, but
some of the critical states are described below to aide in understanding.

Note these sections refer to internal state handling and transitions local to
the target device. For a summary of the over the air sequence see
:ref:`fig-oad-sequence-diagram` and for a breakdown of the different types of
profile messages and how to interpret them over the air please see
:ref:`sect-oad-profile`.

Image Validation
""""""""""""""""

After establishing a new connection, updating the connection interval
for a faster OAD and enabling notifications of OAD Image Identify and
OAD Image Block characteristics on the OAD target, the
OAD distributor shall write to the Image Identify characteristic of the
OAD target. The message data will be the header retrieved from the OAD
Image available for OAD.

On receiving the `Image Identify` message, the
OAD target will verify that the contents of the image can be supported.
This is done by checking the Image Header fields, BIM & header versions, and
length of the image.

The OAD target will then perform boundary checks in the case of an
Application Only or Stack Only OAD. This is done to ensure no boundary violations
will occur between the upgraded image and the images that remain on the device.

Image Block Transfers
"""""""""""""""""""""

After the Image Validation has completed, the OAD target will switch to
the configuration state. There it will get the block size and set image count.
When the OAD distributor sends the Start OAD Command to the Control
Characteristic (for more details see :ref:`tbl-oad-control-supported-commands`),
the OAD target will respond with a Control characteristic notification
requesting the first block. The OAD distributor will then send the first block
to the OAD target.

This process continues with the OAD target notifying the OAD distributor
of the next block it needs and the OAD distributor sending the requested
image block until all blocks have been transferred.

Completion of the OAD Process
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After receiving the complete image, the CRC32 of the entire image will be
calculated and the'CRC32 status' bytes will be set accordingly. If the computed
CRC matches with the 'CRC' field of received image, it switches to 'End' state.

For off-chip OAD, after OAD process is finished, the OAD target checks
that the previous state was OAD Validation. If not, the state machine is reset
and any used buffers are freed.

Next, the Application checks to see if there
are any more images waiting to be downloaded. If there are, the Application
will return to the Image Download state. If there are no more images to download,
the OAD target will check to see if the image that was downloaded should
be copied to internal flash.

If the Enable OAD Image Command has been received, the new image will be copied
to internal flash and the device will be reset. If not, the currently resident
image will continue regular execution.
