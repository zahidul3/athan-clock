RAM
===

There is |SRAM_SIZE| of RAM available in the system. The various sections
of RAM and their associated linker files are as follows.

-  **CSTACK**: This the system callstack used by the C main function and HWIs.
   See :ref:`sec-memory-management-system-stack` for more information

-  **RAM Reset Vector Table**: This table holds entries for all supported
   reset vectors. It is initialized from the flash reset vector table at boot
   time and is used to plug interrupt table entries at runtime. See
   :ref:`sec-ram-vector-table` for more information.

-  **ROM Reserved RAM**: When building a configuration that links to code in
   ROM certain sections of RAM must be reserved for the static allocations
   performed in ROM. This includes the ``RTOSRAM_SIZE`` sections in
   :numref:`fig-stacklib-mem-map`. If the active configuration doesn't use
   ROM,these sections may be used for other purposes.

-  **HEAP**: All configurations require that a heap must be present for
   dynamic memory allocation. This heap is shared between the app and stack.
   There are multiple configurations of the heap that may be used, each has
   associated tradeoffs. See :ref:`dynamic_memory_allocation` for
   information about heaps. Additionally see :ref:`sec-heap-debugging` for more
   information on debugging common heap issues.

For projects where the stack project builds a **library**:

-  **Application and Stack statically allocated data**: This includes any
   initialized and uninitialized variables used by the application or stack.

.. _sec-ram-vector-table:

RAM Vector Table
----------------

As detailed in the :ref:`sec-flash-vector-table` section, this table is
intialized at kernel boot time with the contents of the flash vector table.
The location of this table is controlled by ``m3Hwi.vectorTableAddress`` within
the TI-RTOS config file (`*.cfg`), it defaults to address 0x20000000.
The VTOR register will point to this table, which allows the creation of
dynamic interrupts at runtime. This table will contain entries for all 50
supported interrupts.

For more information about the vector table format,
please refer to `Cortex-M3 Vector Table <http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0552a/BABIFJFG.html>`__.

.. _sec-memory-management-system-stack:

System Stack
------------

As described in :ref:`sec-rtos-overview-tasks`, each task has its own runtime
stack for context switching. Another runtime stack is used by the RTOS for
main(), HWIs, and SWIs. This system stack is allocated in the
application linker file to be placed at the end of the RAM of the
application.

For IAR, this RTOS system stack is defined by the CSTACK symbol:

.. code-block:: c

	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// Stack
	define symbol STACK_SIZE            = 0x400;
	define symbol STACK_START           = RAM_END + 1;
	define symbol STACK_END             = STACK_START - STACK_SIZE;
	//
	define symbol STACK_TOP             = RAM_END + 1;
	export symbol STACK_TOP;

	// Runtime Stack
	define block CSTACK with alignment = 8, size = STACK_SIZE { section .stack };
	place at end of RAM { block CSTACK };

In IAR, to change the size of the CSTACK, adjust the STACK_SIZE symbol value in
the linker configuration file (.icf) of the application.

For CCS, depending on the project's current build configuration the RTOS system
stack is defined by the ``Program.stack`` parameter in the ``ble_debug.cfg`` or
``ble_release.cfg`` RTOS configuration file:

.. code-block:: js

  /* ================ Program configuration ================ */
  /* main() and Hwi, Swi stack size */
  Program.stack = 1024;

and placed by the linker in the RAM space of the application:

.. code-block:: none

	/* Create global constant that points to top of stack */
	/* CCS: Change stack size under Project Properties */
	__STACK_TOP = __stack + __STACK_SIZE;

.. _dynamic_memory_allocation:

Dynamic Memory Allocation
-------------------------

The system uses a single heap for dynamic memory allocation. This heap is shared
between TI-RTOS, the protocol stack, and the application.

The RTOS configuration file that configures the heap depends on the project's
build configuration. If the project's current build configuration is
``FlashROM_Debug`` the file that configures the heap is ``ble_debug.cfg``.
If the project's current build configuration is ``FlashROM_Release`` the file
that configures the heap is ``ble_release.cfg``.

Using the RTOS configuration file above the heap can be configured in one of
three ways. Regardless of the underlying heap implementation, the APIs to access
the heap are common.

  * OSAL Heap (legacy) - This is the legacy heap manager created to work with
    the stack. It is implemented by ``rtos_heaposal.h``.
    The OSAL heap suppports creating variable sized blocks as well as freeing
    blocks.

  * TI-RTOS HeapMem - The most flexible heap implementation offered by
    the TI-RTOS kernel. HeapMem supports creating variable sized blocks as well
    as freeing blocks. It is implemented by ``rtos_heapmem.h`` when using RTOS in
    ROM and by direct calls when using RTOS in flash. See
    :ref:`sec-heapmem-with-rtos-in-rom` for details on using the HeapMem
    module in ROM with the stack.

  * TI-RTOS HeapMem with HeapTrack - The most flexible heap implementation
    offered by the TI-RTOS kernel. HeapMem suppports creating variable sized
    blocks as well as freeing blocks. It is implemented by ``rtos_heaptrack.h``
    when using RTOS in ROM and by direct calls when using RTOS in flash.
    On top of the functionality offered by HeapMem, HeapTrack offers additional
    debugging capability, at the cost of runtime performance. See
    :ref:`sec-heapmem-with-rtos-in-rom` for details on using the HeapMem module
    in ROM with the stack.


.. _sec-configuring-the-heap:

Configuring the Heap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The active heap configuration is set via the ``HEAPMGR_CONFIG`` variable. If
auto heapsizing is not used, the size of the heap is controlled via
``HEAPMGR_SIZE``.The location of both the ``HEAPMGR_CONFIG`` and
``HEAPMGR_SIZE`` variables are dependent on the project's current build
configuration. These variables are defined in the app's ``.cfg`` file.


The system will default to using the OSAL heap with auto heap size. The table
below shows the possible configurations of the heap along with their associated
values of ``HEAPMGR_CONFIG`` and ``HEAPMGR_SIZE``.


+--------------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

+--------------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

.. warning::
    If autoheap size is to be used, ``heapStart`` and ``heapEnd`` symbols must
    be defined in the linker file. See your application's map file for the
    location of these sections in the StackLibrary configuration.

     - ``heapStart`` -- Placed at end of static allocation section
     - ``heapEnd`` -- Placed right before beginning of CSTACK section

See the snippet below from  the app's ``.cfg`` to see how to change the
active heap configuration. Change the variable in the highlighted line to one of
the values supported in the table above.

  .. code-block:: js
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2


    var Memory = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Memory');
    var HEAPMGR_CONFIG = 0x00;  //set to OSAL HeapMgr, static heap size
    var HEAPMGR_SIZE   = 30000; //only valid if static size is used. This is the
                                //size of the buffer allocated for Heap.

.. _sec-heapmem-with-rtos-in-rom:

HeapMem with TI-RTOS in ROM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using any HeapMem based configuration combined with TI-RTOS in ROM, the
heap will be implemented by HeapCallback module. HeapCallback will call
a user defined function whenever a dynamic memory operation is required. The
user defined functions are located in the following files.

 * ``rtos_heapmem.h`` -- HeapMem
 * ``rtos_heaptrack.h`` -- HeapMem + HeapTrack

This is required because the HeapMem implementation in ROM uses the GateMutex
module, which prevents ``malloc()`` from being called in a :term:`hwi` or
:term:`swi`. In order to allow safe use of the heap a GateHWI must be used. To
work around this, the HeapCallback implementation will wrap any access to the
heap in a HWI lock. See the following example from ``rtos_heapmem.h``.


  .. code-block:: c

    /* Protect since HeapMem_allocUnprotected does not */
    hwikey = (uint_least16_t)Hwi_disable();

    /* Using the default system heap for this example */
    tmp = HeapMem_allocUnprotected(stackHeap, size, FORCED_ALIGNEMENT);

    // ..

    /* restore the hwi mutex */
    Hwi_restore(hwikey);

  .. note::
    Note that the legacy OSAL heap always protects heap operations with a HWI
    lock.

When using a flash based kernel, the HeapMem module is configured to use a
GateHWI, see the following excerpt from ``ble_debug.cfg``.

  .. code-block:: js

    Program.global.stackHeap = HeapMem.create(heapMemParams);
    var GateHwi = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.gates.GateHwi');
    HeapMem.common$.gate = GateHwi.create();
    Memory.defaultHeapInstance = Program.global.stackHeap;

Profiling the Heap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Refer to :ref:`sect_icall_profiling` for tips on debugging common heap issues.
Each heap implementation has its benefits for debugging and some come with
performance tradeoffs. Note the metrics function may be
used by any supported heap configuration.

.. note::
    The auto heap size feature does not determine the amount
    of heap needed for the application. The system designer must ensure
    that the heap has the required space to meet the application's
    runtime memory requirements.


Heap APIs
^^^^^^^^^

Note that regardless of the heap implementation selected, the APIs are
compatible across all supported heap implementations. The following APIs may be
used to access the heap:

  - ``ICall_heapMalloc``    -- Dynamically allocate a block of memory
  - ``ICall_heapFree``      -- Dynamically free a block of memory
  - ``ICall_heapRealloc``   -- Resize an existing heap block
  - ``ICall_heapGetStats``  -- Get information about the state of the heap

The following is an example of dynamically allocating a variable
length (n) array using the ICall heap:

.. code-block:: c

	//define pointer
	uint8_t *pArray;
	// Create dynamic pointer to array.
	if (pArray = (uint8_t*)ICall_malloc(n*sizeof(uint8_t)))
	{
	//fill up array
	}
	else
	{
	//not able to allocate
	}


The following is an example of freeing the previous array:

.. code-block:: c

	ICall_free(pMsg->payload);

Cache
=====

The cache is an 8 KB section of the device's RAM reserved for the processor. The
cache module temporarily stores data that has been read from the Flash, so that
frequently used data is not fetched from Flash on each access. This reduces the
number of CPU wait-states and saves power. When the cache is not used, it is not
powered. This is true for Standby and Idle states where the cache is not in use.


AUX RAM
=======

The AUX RAM is a 2 KB memory area belonging to the :ref:`sensor-controller`.
