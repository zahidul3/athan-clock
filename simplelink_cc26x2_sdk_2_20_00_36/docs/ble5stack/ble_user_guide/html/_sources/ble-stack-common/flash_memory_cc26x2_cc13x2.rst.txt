Flash
=====

The flash is split into erasable pages of |FLASH_PAGE_SIZE|. The various
sections of flash and their associate linker files are as follows.

-  **Flash Reset Vector Table**: This table holds the first 16 reset vectors
   that are critical for booting up the device. These vectors are set at build
   time and cannot be dynamically changed. See :ref:`sec-flash-vector-table`
   below for more information.

-  **Simple NV (SNV) Area**: used for nonvolatile memory storage by the GAP
   Bond Manager and also available for use by the application. See
   :ref:`using-simple-nv` for configuring SNV.

For projects where the stack project builds a **library**:

-  **Application and Stack Image Code Space**: A single region that contains
   both application and stack code in flash.
   This image is configured in the linker configuration file of the application:
   <device name>\_app\_and\_stack.icf (IAR) and <device name>\_app.cmd (CCS).

.. _sec-flash-vector-table:

Flash Vector Table
------------------

This table contains the first 16 critical interrupt vectors required for the
bootup process. The location of this table is controlled by
`m3Hwi.resetVectorAddress` within the TI-RTOS config file (`*.cfg`), it defaults
to address 0x00000000. At bootup time, the TI-RTOS kernel will run a first
function to initialize the :term:`Hwi` module. At this time the flash vector
table will be copied to the RAM location shown in :numref:`fig-stacklib-mem-map`
and the VTOR register will be moved to point to the RAM table.
For more information about the vector table format, please refer to
`Cortex-M3 Vector Table <http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0552a/BABIFJFG.html>`__.

Non-Volatile Storage Architecture
---------------------------------

This section will describe the non volatile storage system that is implemented
and used on the |DEVICE|. This system provides access to non volatile storage
that can be safely shared between the user application and the protocol stack.

The system has the following properties and offers the following features:

 - Thread safe access to non volatile memory
 - ID based system that decouples a storage item from its address in memory
 - Space efficient storage with automatic compaction
 - Power loss tolerant data preservation

The implementation of this software system relies on several layers which are
illustrated below.

    |       Flash APIs      |
    +-----------------------+

Non Volatile Interface (NVINTF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The NVINTF is an abstraction layer that defines a common set of APIs for
interacting with non volatile memory using a ID system. This common set of APIs
allow for new methods of NV storage to be implemented without changing the
API calls in the stack and application. The ID system is most efficient because
it decouples the data stored from its address in flash. This is necessary
because flash banks must have the entire sector erased before writing again.
(with the exception of clearing a bit). Using the ID system, when an NV item
needs to be updated, it can simply be invalidated and stored again at a
different address. Once the NV system becomes full of unused items, a compaction
will occur. A compaction is the removal of unused items.

The NVINTF is function pointer based, each underlying transport must plug
a function table and provide an implementation for the common set of APIs.

This interface is defined in ``nvintf.h``. The NVINTF is not intended to be
changed by the customer, but instead used as is.

Two Page Non Volatile Memory On Chip (NVOCTP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVOCTP is an implementation of the NVINTF that uses two flash pages to store
NV data. The design is such that a single page is active at a given time and
when that page is at the compaction threshold, a compaction is performed and the
other page will become the active page. With two pages in use, the system is
protected against power loss during compaction. The implementation of the two
page system is done in ``nvoctp.c``. The stack will use this implementation by
default.

NVOCTP also defines an NV header that is used by every entry in the NV.
This header is implemented by ``NVOCTP_itemHdr_t`` and is defined as below.
The header is used to determine the integrity of an item and whether it is in
use.

.. _fig-nvintf-header:

    :align: center

Non Volatile Storage (NVS) Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The NVS driver provides reentrant functions for writing to and reading from
flash. It also provides a common interface to both internal and external flash.
More information can be found in the TI Drivers documentation. The stack will
use internal NV, currently this is all that is supported.


Non Volatile Storage with the BLE-Stack
---------------------------------------

The BLE-Stack implements some additional layers on top of the NVINTF.
These additional layers define the recommended interaction between BLE enabled
applications, the BLE-Stack, and the NVINTF implementation.

The additional layers required when using BLE stack are listed below:

 - ICall: NV interactions occur in stack thread facilitated by ICall
 - OSAL SNV: A wrapper on top of the NVINTF that defines a NV tag structure for
   BLE

The figure below shows the architecture of the entire system.

OSAL Simple NV (OSAL SNV)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GAP Bond Manager will use OSAL SNV for storing persistent data, such as
encryption keys from bonding. The OSAL SNV layer is implemented via a simple
wrapper that defines a higher level structure on top of the existing
``NVINTF_itemID_t`` structure. At a high level this simply maps the
``osalSnvId_t`` that is used by the stack to ``NVINTF_itemID_t`` that is used
by the NVINTF layer. It will always use ``NVINTF_SYSID_BLE`` when storing
OSAL SNV data. The ID system implemented is detailed below. By default, the IDs
available to the customer are defined in bcomdef.h as shown in
:numref:`lst-inc_flash_snv`

.. _lst-inc_flash_snv:

    #define BLE_NVID_GAP_BOND_END           0x5f  //!< End of the GAP Bond Manager's NV IDs Range

    #define BLE_NVID_CUST_END               0x8F  //!< End of the Customer's NV IDs

Additionally it will set a compact level via the GAP Bond Manager which
defaults to 80%. This is set by the ``NV_COMPACT_THRESHOLD`` define.

By default, osalSnvId\_t and osalSnvLen\_t are type defined as uint8. To use
uint16-type definitions, define the preprocessor symbol OSAL\_SNV\_UINT16\_ID
in both the application and stack projects.

This layer is implemented by ``osal_snv_wrapper.c``.

Limitations and Intended Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following limitations apply to those using NV alongside the |STACK|.

 - NV inmplementations (i.e. NVOCTP) must not be used directly, instead the
   application should access NV through OSAL SNV. See :ref:`lst-snv_api_usage`
 - The application must be careful to only use IDs in the range defined by
   :numref:`lst-inc_flash_snv`
 - The application cannot access the NV regions reserved by the stack directly
   or the internal structure may be corrupted.
 - When using NVOCTP, the memory allocated for internal NVS access must be two
   pages of contiguous memory.
 - Since OSAL SNV exists on the stack side of ICall, an application that uses
   OSAL SNV must be ICall enabled.
 - OSAL SNV operations must be called from a task context and not a :term:`Hwi`
   or :term:`SWI` context.


OSAL SNV API Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SNV can be read from or written to using the following APIs.

**uint8 osal\_snv\_read( osalSnvId\_t id, osalSnvLen\_t len, void
\*pBuf)**

OSAL SNV Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:numref:`lst-snv_api_usage` shows how to read and write an array of bytes from
SNV flash:

.. _lst-snv_api_usage:
.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Using SNV Example Code
    :emphasize-lines: 5, 13, 21, 26

    /*********************************************************************
    * GLOBAL VARIABLES
    */

    #include <icall_ble_api.h> // OSAL SNV operations are defined through ICALL

    // ...

    #define BUF_LEN 4
    #define SNV_ID_APP 0x80
    // Assuming Two Button menu is used
    #define SP_NVS_DEBUG         (TBM_ROW_APP + 10)
    uint8 buf[BUF_LEN] ={0,};

    static void SimplePeripheral_taskFxn(UArg a0, UArg a1)
    {
      // Initialize application
      SimpleBLEPeripheral_init();
      uint8 status = SUCCESS;

      status = osal_snv_read(SNV_ID_APP, BUF_LEN, (uint8 *)buf);
      if(status != SUCCESS)
      {
        Display_printf(dispHandle, 0, SP_NVS_DEBUG, "SNV READ FAIL: %d", status);
        //Write first time to initialize SNV ID
        osal_snv_write(SNV_ID_APP, BUF_LEN, (uint8 *)buf);
      }

      //Increment first element of array and write to SNV flash
      buf[0]++;
      status = osal_snv_write(SNV_ID_APP, BUF_LEN, (uint8 *)buf);
      if(status != SUCCESS)
      {
        Display_printf(dispHandle, 0, SP_NVS_DEBUG, "SNV WRITE FAIL: %d", status);
      }
      else
      {
        Display_printf(dispHandle, 0, SP_NVS_DEBUG, "Num of Resets: %d", buf[0]);
      }

      // Application main loop
      for (;;)
      {
      //...
      }
    }

No prior initialization of a NV item ID is required; the OSAL SNV manager
initializes the NV ID when first accessed by a successful osal\_snv\_write()
call.

When reading or writing large amounts of data to SNV, TI recommends placing the
read/write data in statically (linker) allocated arrays or buffers allocated
from the heap. Placing large amounts of data in local arrays may result in a
task stack overflow.

Placing OSAL SNV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section details how the SNV flash sector is placed in memory.
OSAL SNV is implemented as a constant array defined in the board file
as ``flashBuf[REGIONSIZE]``. The location of this buffer is set by
``NVS_REGIONS_BASE`` in the `*_LAUNCHXL.c` board file. Placement of this
structure is flexible and configurable by the user so long as the intended use
guidelines are followed.

This structure is accessed via the NVINTF through ``NVSCC26XX_*`` APIs.

.. _cca:

Customer Configuration (CCFG) Table
-----------------------------------

The CCFG is placed at the end of the last flash page and lets
customer configure various chip and system parameters in the Customer
Configuration (CCFG) table. The CCFG table is defined in ccfg\_app\_ble.c,
which can be found in the Startup folder of the application project. The last
(sizeof(ccfg_t)) bytes of the CCFG sector are reserved by the system for the
CCFG table. By default, the linker allocates the unused flash of the last flash
page to the application image for code and data use.

See the |TRM| for details on CCFG fields and related configuration options,
including how to set the CCFG to disable access to internal flash memory
contents.

.. note::

  The CCFG cannot be relocated, and must reside at the end of the last page of
  flash. Consult the |TRM| for more information.
