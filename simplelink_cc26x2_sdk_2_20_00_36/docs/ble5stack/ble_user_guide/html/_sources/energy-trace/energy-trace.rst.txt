EnergyTrace User Guide
----------------------

EnergyTrace |trade| technology is a power analyzer tool for CCS that measures
the application's current consumption. The tool can be used stand-alone as a
power profiling tool, or in EnergyTrace++ mode within a debug session for code
analysis to help optimize the application for ultra-low-power consumption.


EnergyTrace stand-alone Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following discusses the necessary steps to use EnergyTrace in
stand-alone-mode on |LP|. In stand-alone mode, the debugger is not active and
the displayed current consumption is what to expect for the final
application. As opposite to EnergyTrace++ where the debug interface on the
device is active and the current consumption from the debugger will be added to
the displayed current.


1. Flash the target device with the application to be analyzed.
   
2. Make sure no debug session is active and click the EnergyTrace Button as seen in
   :numref:`fig-energytrace-standalone-button`

.. _fig-energytrace-standalone-button:
.. figure:: resources/fig-energytrace-standalone-button.png
    :align: center

    Start EnergyTrace

3. A dialog with instructions on how to use EnergyTrace Stand-alone Measurement
   Mode will pop-up. Click ``Proceed`` to continue. 

4. The first time EnergyTrace is being used within a CCS Workspace some settings
   needs to be set. In the EnergyTrace Window, click on the ``Advanced Menu`` icon
   and select ``Preferences``, as :numref:`fig-energytrace-preferences-button`
   shows.

.. _fig-energytrace-preferences-button:
.. figure:: resources/fig-energytrace-preferences-button.png

5. Under ``Target Connection``, set ``Connection`` to ``XDS110`` and ``Voltage``
   to 3300.0 mV. ``ET-HDR Range Selector`` shall be set to ``Low current,
   narrower range higher accuracy``. If you want to save the captured data to a
   .cvs-file for further analysis, select ``Raw data to CSV file``. You can also
   select the battery cell type the application will be using to get an
   estimated life time of the application. Click ``Ok`` to save the preferences.

6. Select how long you want to capture data by clicking the ``Select Measurement
   Duration`` button as in :numref:`fig-energytrace-standalone-time`

.. _fig-energytrace-standalone-time:
.. figure:: resources/fig-energytrace-standalone-time.png
    :align: center

    Select Measurement Duration

7. To start capturing data, click the green play button.

.. _fig-energytrace-standalone-start:
.. figure:: resources/fig-energytrace-standalone-start.png
    :align: center

    Start trace collection

8. When EnergyTrace is finished capturing data, review the application's power
   profile and have a closer look in the Current
   graph. :numref:`fig-energytrace-standalone-graph` shows a zoomed-in current
   graph of BLE advertising.

EnergyTrace++ Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run EnergyTrace++, which allows more detailed data regarding power
consumption, the Target Configuration file must be configured to allow for a
different debugging interface. Specifically, to use EnergyTrace++, the debugger
must be set to 4-pin cJTAG mode. The following discusses the necessary steps to
modify the Target Configuration file and view EnergyTrace++ data on |LP|.

.. warning:: In EnergyTrace++ mode, the displayed current consists of the
   application current consumption AND the device debugger current
   consumption. Use EnergyTrace stand-alone mode to display only the application
   current consumption.

EnergyTrace++ Update Target Configuration Instructions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. In the CCS, using the Project Explorer, navigate to the ``targetConfigs``
   folder.

2. Double click on the ``*.ccxml`` file to open a configuration menu as seen in
   :numref:`fig-ccxml-config-menu`

.. _fig-ccxml-config-menu:
.. figure:: resources/fig-ccxml-config-menu.png
    :width: 3.0in

    Open .ccxml file

3. On the bottom of the window, navigate to the ``Advanced`` tab as seen in
   :numref:`fig-advanced-settings`

.. _fig-advanced-settings:
.. figure:: resources/fig-advanced-settings.png
    :width: 3.0in

    Navigate to Advanced Settings Tab

4. In the ``All Connections`` windows pane, click on the highest level from the
   list tree as seen in :numref:`fig-connection-properties`

5. In the ``Connection Properties`` window pane, modify the ``JTAG/SWD/cJTAG
   Mode`` parameter to ``cJTAG (1149.7) 4-pin standard mode`` from the dropdown
   menu as seen in :numref:`fig-connection-properties`

.. _fig-connection-properties:
.. figure:: resources/fig-connection-properties.png
    :width: 6.0in

    Configure 4-pin cJTAG Mode

6. After selecting this option, click ``Save`` in the previous ``All
   Connections`` window pane.

7. Close the ``.ccxml`` file.

Using EnergyTrace++ Instructions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This section assumes the user has already configured their Target Configuration
settings to point use ``cJTAG (1149.7) 4-pin standard mode`` as described in
the :ref:`energytrace-update-target-conf` section above.

1. After the Build has successfully completed, ``Debug`` the project.

2. Open the EnergyTrace Tool by clicking the button seen below in
   :numref:`fig-energytrace-pp-button`

.. _fig-energytrace-pp-button:
.. figure:: resources/fig-energytrace-pp-button.png
    :width: 4.03594in

    Enable EnergyTrace Tool

3. On the far right of the ``EnergyTrace Technology`` window, click the
   ``Switch to EnergyTrace++`` button as seen in
   :numref:`fig-switch-to-energytrace-pp`

.. _fig-switch-to-energytrace-pp:
.. figure:: resources/fig-switch-to-energytrace-pp.png
    :width: 6in

    Switch to EnergyTrace++ Mode

4. You should see an additional ``States`` tab popup.

5. Run the Debug session, click the green arrow button (F8).

6. You should now be able to observe the enhanced EnergyTrace++ details in the
   ``EnergyTrace Technology`` and ``States`` tabs as seen in
   :numref:`fig-energytrace-pp-tab` and :numref:`fig-energytrace-pp-tab-states`

Troubleshooting
"""""""""""""""

If EnergyTrace is not able to properly setup remote controls for the
device, try closing CCS, resetting your Evaluation Board and starting
again.
