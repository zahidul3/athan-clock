This section will explain how to adapt a BLE application from the |SDK| to run on
custom hardware. In general, the steps required to migrate a BLE application
from a development kit to a custom board are minimal and involve changing the
pin configuration as well as selecting the correct RF configuration.
These steps, including a bring up guide, are detailed in the subsections below.

Creating a Custom Board File
----------------------------

TI-RTOS drivers rely on "board files" for their board-specific configuration
parameters. The convention is to name these files based on the development kits
provided by TI in addition to a generic ``Board.h`` with ``Board_*`` definitions
to map the proper pins defined by ``ioc.h``.

For example, for the simple\_peripheral project, the following comprise the
set of board files used by the |DEVBOARD| development kit:

* Board.h
* CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL.h
* CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL.c

.. note::
    For the **SimpleLink CC13x2 SDK**, you would use the CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL.h and
    CC1352R1_LAUNCHXL.c board files.

TI recommends to start with these existing set of board files when porting
a BLE application to custom development boards. When modifying or porting these
board files, user should consult with
`TI Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.

.. tip::
    Board files provided by TI include TI-RTOS driver configuration data
    structures for various drivers. If the application does not use the
    associated TI-RTOS drivers, the linker will simply omit them from the
    application image.

The following steps provide guidance on customizing board files for a
|STACKVER| project.

#. Duplicate existing board files from existing ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL`` board files.

    - These files can be found at:
      ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\source\ti\boards\CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL``

    - Create a copy of the ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL`` directory and give it a unique
      meaningful name for your development platform. In this example, we call
      it ``MYBOARD``.

    .. caution::
        The |SDK| also contains board files for TI-RTOS kernel and driver examples.
        These are not compatible with the |STACKVER| because of differences in
        RF driver SWI priorities and custom drivers (e.g. TRNG) requiired by
        |STACKVER|. For |STACK| projects, use the files specified above for
        reference from simple\_peripheral.

    - In the ``MYBOARD`` directory, rename ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL.c`` and
      ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL.h`` to their ``MYBOARD.c`` and ``MYBOARD.h``
      respectively.

    - Search and replace all references of ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL`` with
      ``MYBOARD`` in ``Board.h``, ``MYBOARD.c`` and ``MYBOARD.h``.

#. Add a new preprocessor define in your project's ``board.c`` and ``board.h``
   files.

    Continuing with the ``MYBOARD`` example, modify ``board.c`` and ``board.h``
    in ``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\source\ti\target``

    - Replace ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL`` by ``MYBOARD`` in your project's application
      predefined symbols (See :ref:`sec-compiler-options`)

    - In ``board.h``, add a link to your ``Board.h`` file.

        .. code-block:: c
            :linenos:
            :emphasize-lines: 3-4

            #elif defined(CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL)
                #include "./cc26x2r1lp/cc26x2r1lp_board.h"
            #elif defined(MYBOARD)
                #include "../../boards/MYBOARD/Board.h"

    - In ``board.c``, add the highlighted lines shown below:

        .. code-block:: c
            :linenos:
            :emphasize-lines: 3-5

            #elif defined(CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL)
                #include "./cc26x2r1lp/cc26x2r1lp_board.c"
            #elif defined(MYBOARD)
                #include "../../boards/MYBOARD/Board.h"
                #include "../../boards/MYBOARD/MYBOARD.c"

    - Explicit references to ``CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL.h`` need to be replaced by
      ``MYBOARD.h``

#. Modify board files to match application requirements

    - PIN structure to match the layout of the board.

    - Add peripheral driver initialization objects according to the board design.
      The TI Drivers documentation for more information.

    - For RF driver configuration,
      see :ref:`sec-creating-a-custom-ble-app-rf-front-end-and-antennas`

Board Level Middleware
----------------------

There are also several board driver files which are a layer of
abstraction on top of TI-RTOS drivers, to function for a specific
board, for example Board_key.c, or ExtFlash.c If desired, these files can be
adapted to work for a custom board.

Using 32-kHz Crystal-Less Mode
------------------------------

|STACKVER| includes support for operating the |DEVICE| in a 32-kHz
crystal-less mode for peripheral and broadcaster (beacon) role configurations.
By using the internal low-frequency RC oscillator (RCOSC_LF), the 32-kHz crystal
can be removed from the board layout.


There are a few steps that must be taken to enable this feature.
For any peripheral project, the following change is required for IAR.
For CCS user, please see the
`Running Bluetooth Low Energy on CC2640 Without 32 kHz Crystal <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/swra499>`_
for the needed steps to enable RCOSC_LF in your project.
You will find more detail regarding this feature in the aforementioned application note.

1. Include ```rcosc_calibration.c``, ``rcosc_calibration.h`` and
   ``ccfg_app_ble_rcosc.c`` files which locate at
   *<SDK\_INSTALL\_DIR>\\source\\ti\\ble5stack\\common\\cc26xx\\rcosc*

2. Exclude ccfg_app_ble.c from build.

3. Add USE_RCOSC to the ``.opt`` file containing the application defines.

4. Add the following code to your peripheral project.c

   .. code-block:: c
        :caption: RCOSC calibration include
        :name: include RCOSC_calibration

        #ifdef USE_RCOSC
        #include "rcosc_calibration.h"
        #endif //USE_RCOSC

5. Add the following code to your peripheralproject_init function in peripheral project.c

   .. code-block:: c
        :caption: RCOSC calibration enable
        :name: enable RCOSC_calibration

        #ifdef USE_RCOSC
        RCOSC_enableCalibration();
        #endif // USE_RCOSC

6. If using a custom board file, enable the RCOSC in the power policy.
   The board files included with the |STACK|:

   .. code-block:: c
        :caption: Power driver configuration
        :name: Power driver code snippet
        :emphasize-lines: 6

        PowerCC26X2_Config PowerCC26X2_config = {
          .policyInitFxn     = NULL,
          .policyFxn         = &PowerCC26XX_standbyPolicy,
          .calibrateFxn      = &PowerCC26XX_calibrate,
          .enablePolicy      = TRUE,
          .calibrateRCOSC_LF = TRUE,
          .calibrateRCOSC_HF = TRUE,
        };

7. Constrain the temperature variation to be less than 1°C/sec. If the
   temperature is to change faster than 1°C/sec, then a short
   calibration interval must be used.
   Calibration interval can be tuned in rcosc_calibration.h

   .. code-block:: c
        :caption: RCOSCLF calibration interval
        :name: RCOSCLF calibration interval setup

        // 1000 ms
        #define RCOSC_CALIBRATION_PERIOD   1000

.. note::
    Use of the internal RCOSC_LF requires a sleep clock accuracy (SCA) of 500 ppm.

Configuring the RF Front-End for Custom Hardware
------------------------------------------------

The |DEVICE| supports multiple RF front end options to optimize performance or
cost. Reference designs are available for multiple RF front end options to aid
in decoupling and RF layout. In order to achieve optimal sensitivity, it is
important to configure the BLE application with the correct RF front end setting
used on the custom board. An incorrectly configured RF front end may result in
substantially degraded RF performance such as the inability to maintain a
connection with a peer device. Configuration of the Front-EndRF front end is
done within the board file.

For example, within the simple\_peripheral project, the RF front end
configuration is specified by defining ``CC26X2`` via the ``.opt`` file.

The defined symbol is used in ``ble_user_config.h`` and ``ble_user_config.c``
to set the correct RF Front end mode, and the select the appropriate PA table
for that configuration. In ble_user_config.h, ``CC26X2`` is processed to
define ``RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS``:

  .. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #elif defined( CC26X2 )

      #define RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS           ( RF_FE_DIFFERENTIAL | \
                                              RF_FE_INT_BIAS)


.. note::
    For the **SimpleLink CC13x2 SDK**, you would use "-DCC13X2".

This configures the project to use a differential RF with internal bias.
Other configurations can also be found in ``ble_user_config.h``, select the
configuration appropriate to your project.

.. note::
  There are several other parameters being configured in ``ble_user_config``.
  For |DEVICE| it is only the RF front end mode and PA table that have to be
  changed for different boards.

For information on front ends and antenna configurations, see
`CC26xx RF FrontEnds and Antennas <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/4/45/CC26xx_HW_training_RF_Frontends_and_Antennas.pdf>`_.

For information on other hardware considerations, see |BLEWIKI|.

Configuring Device Parameters for Custom Hardware
-------------------------------------------------

  1.  Set parameters, such as the sleep clock accuracy of the 32.768-kHz
      crystal. See :ble_api:`HCI_EXT_SetSCACmd`

  2.  Define the CCFG parameters in ccfg\_app\_ble.c to enable or
      disable the ROM serial bootloader, JTAG access (DAP), flash
      protection, and so forth.

.. note::
    For a description of CCFG configuration parameters, see the |TRM|.

Initial Board Bring Up
----------------------

When powering up a custom board with the |DEVICE| for the first time, it is
recommended to complete the HW checklist items on the TI BLE Wiki.
After confirming that the board is being powered correctly by the battery or
power supply and can be identified by the JTAG tool, programming the device with
a minimal SW application to verify stability is also suggested.

TI recommends using the simple_peripheral sample application for initial board
bring  up with modifications to the board file to:

1. Disable all GPIO pin access
2. Select the correct RF front end setting.


To disable all GPIO pin configuration, set the ``BoardGpioInitTable`` in the
board file to ``PIN_TERMINATE``:

  .. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    const PIN_Config BoardGpioInitTable[] = {

        PIN_TERMINATE
    };

The TI |STACK| does not require any GPIO pins to be configured in order to
establish and maintain a BLE connection. Ensure that ``Display_DISABLE_ALL``
is defined in the application Predefined Symbols so that diagnostic logging
data is not routed to any GPIO pin. If your custom board uses a different device
configuration, such as the 32 kHz crystal-less RCOSC_LF configuration, be sure
to make these device changes to the project. With this minimal application
configuration you should be able to establish a BLE connection
(e.g., with a smart phone or BTool) to your board at the expected range.
If you are not able to complete this step, then it is likely there is a
misconfiguration of the RF front end or you have other board related or layout
issues. Refer to the hardware troubleshooting tips on the TI BLE Wiki.

After confirming that your board can maintain a BLE connection, you can now
validate that your BLE application functions as expected on the custom board.
Again, it is suggested to enable your GPIO pins one at a time in the board file
and comment-out access to other GPIO pins in your application. If you do
encounter a CPU exception (HWI abort) during this phase it is likely that a
GPIO pin is incorrectly mapped in your custom board file or your application is
attempting to access a GPIO pin that does not exist in your device package type.
