A system designer must have a firm grasp on the general system
architecture, application, and Bluetooth low energy stack framework
to implement a custom Bluetooth low energy application. This section
provides indications and guidance on where and how to start
implementing a custom application based on information presented in
the previous sections (:ref:`the_application` and :ref:`the_stack`)
as well as knowledge of TI-RTOS and |DEVICE|.

Decide what role and purpose the custom application should have. If an
application is tied to a specific service or profile, start with that sample
application.

A project's role can be essentially be placed in one of the five (5)
categories as described by :ref:`gap_roles`.


Defining Application Behavior
-----------------------------

The Sample Applications will often contain simple TI-RTOS tasks with a barebones
messaging system between tasks. For more information on how the application
tasks works in general, review :ref:`the_application`.

.. _creating-a-custom-ble-app_directed_advertisements:

Directed Advertisements as GATT Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In |STACKVER|, Privacy is always enabled. Most of the privacy
features are handled by the GAP bond manager in the stack. To conserve
flash memory, by default, the GAP bond manager does not enable GATT
client features. The implication of these disabled GATT client features
is that the GAP bond manager will not query the Central Address
Resolution characteristic of the remote device.

In order to perform a directed advertisement when the initiator's
address is set to Private Resolvable Address, the peripheral device
must read the Central Address Resolution characteristic of its remote
device to make sure address resolution is supported. Failure to do so
before sending directed advertisements violates the |CORESPEC|.

By default, sample applications such as simple\_peripheral does not define GATT_NO_CLIENT
and initializes the GATT Client as shown below:

  .. code-block:: c
    :caption: Compiling using GATT_NO_CLIENT

      // Initialize GATT Client, used by GAPBondMgr to look for RPAO characteristic for network privacy
      GATT_InitClient();

.. _sec-compiler-options:

Compiler Options
----------------

For |STACK| projects, compiler options are defined via ``.opt`` files that are
included in the IDE's ``TOOLS\defines`` folder. Each project's build
configuration will include its very own ``.opt`` file.

The predefined symbols in the ``.opt`` files are prefixed with a ``-D``, which
is standard commandline prefix notation across all the supported toolchains.
Of the predefined symbols in the ``.opt`` files, some of them are configurable
and some are not. See :ref:`appconfigurablefeatures`
and :ref:`stackconfigurablefeatures` for reference as to which options are
configurable.

The convention to disable a symbol in the ``.opt`` files is to put an 'x' in
front of the name. For example, to disable power management,
change ``-DPOWER_SAVING`` to ``-DxPOWER_SAVING``. It is also possible to disable
a symbol by commenting it out via 'C - style' syntax
(e.g. ``/* -DPOWER_SAVING */``)

.. warning::
  Changes in an ``.opt`` file may not be detected by the compiler/toolchain.
  It is best to rebuild the entire project when a define is changed.

Linker Options
--------------

Linker symbols may need to be set or adjusted at the project level in order to
control the memory layout of the generated image.
The following procedure describes how to access and modify linker
symbols.

.. _sec-creating-custom-ble-application-creating-additional-tasks:

Creating Additional ICall Enabled Tasks
---------------------------------------

.. warning::
    TI Recommends limiting the number of ICall enabled tasks due to resource usage.
    For more information on creating ICall enabled tasks,
    see `Adding ICall RTOS Tasks <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Adding_Custom_RTOS_Task>`_

The objective of this section is to familiarize the programmer with the
process of adding an RTOS task that can communicate with the |STACK|. Tasks
call functions within the |STACK| must follow a few additional steps
to register with ICall. These details are covered below:

1. Follow all the steps detailed in :ref:`sec-rtos-overview-tasks` to
create a TI-RTOS task.

2. Modify the task's init function to register with ICall
   (explained in :ref:`the-application-icall-initialization-and-registration`)

  .. code-block:: c
    :linenos:
    :caption: ICall Registration for custom task

    // ******************************************************************
    // N0 STACK API CALLS CAN OCCUR BEFORE THIS CALL TO ICall_registerApp
    // ******************************************************************
    // Register the current thread as an ICall dispatcher application
    // so that the application can send and receive messages.
    ICall_registerApp(&selfEntity, &syncEvent);

3. Modify the task's main function to pend on ``syncEvent``
   (explained in :ref:`sec-the-application-icall-thread-sync`)

  .. code-block:: c
    :linenos:
    :caption: ICall Wait

    static void NotificationTask_taskFxn(UArg a0, UArg a1)
    {
      // Initialize application
      NotificationTask_init();

      // Application main loop
      for (;;)
      {
          // Waits for an event to be posted associated with the calling thread.
          // Note that an event associated with a thread is posted when a
          // message is queued to the message receive queue of the thread
          events = Event_pend(syncEvent, Event_Id_NONE, SBP_ALL_EVENTS, ICALL_TIMEOUT_FOREVER);

          //...
      }
      // ...
    }

4. Modify number of ICall enabled tasks:

  - Increase the following preprocessor defines:

    - ICALL\_MAX\_NUM\_TASKS (**App**)
    - OSAL\_MAX\_NUM\_PROXY\_TASKS (**Stack**)

  - See :ref:`sec-compiler-options` for steps on how to change symbols.

.. warning::
  If OSAL\_MAX\_NUM\_PROXY\_TASKS and ICALL\_MAX\_NUM\_TASKS do not match, the
  stack will abort.

5. Modify number of ICall entities:

  - Increase the following preprocessor defines:

    - ICALL\_MAX\_NUM\_ENTITIES (**App**)

For further description of the above preprocessor defines, please see :numref:`stackconfigurablefeatures`


.. _sec-using-production-test-mode:

Using Production Test Mode (PTM)
--------------------------------

PTM is a way to pass HCI commands from an external communication protocol to
the controller of the |STACK|.

This section provide a brief overview of enabling PTM and an example of
how to implement PTM on on a stack library **simple\_peripheral** project
using UART as the transfer protocol. The steps shown will be using IAR,
however the steps are the same for CCS.

To enable PTM and send the HCI status back via external transport protocol,
the application must:

  #. **Add NPI to the Application Project**

       Network Processor Interface (NPI) is utilized to move HCI commands from
       the various entities in the embedded application. Relevant NPI files will
       need to be added to the application to enable access for this
       functionality.

  #. **Configure NPI to Receive Commands From Transport Protocol**

       A transport protocol is used to transfer commands and status between a
       BLE HCI Tester and the application. NPI currently supports SPI and
       UART protocols. UART will be used in the example below. NPI by default
       utilizes a handshake/flow control system to signal when a slave is ready
       to transmit/receive and when a master is ready to transmit/receive.
       This feature will be disabled as the functionality is not needed.
       For more information
       on NPI see `NPI Wiki <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/NPI>`_


  #. **Send HCI Commands Using ICall Direct API**

       The embedded application must intercept the NPI Frame and send the
       message to the BLE-Stack through the enhanced ICall’s direct message API.
       To configure NPI to only send messages to the embedded
       application, the ``NPITask_registerIncomingRXEventAppCB`` function is
       utilized to tell NPI to ``INTERCEPT`` messages and send them to a
       function which will then utilize ICall Direct API. The ICall HCI
       Transport Layer (``icall_hci_tl.c``) will also be added to the project.
       ICall Direct API for any given HCI command can be translated from an
       NPI frame via ``HCI_TL_SendToStack``, defined by the ICall HCI Transport
       Layer, into a Direct API expected by the BLE-Stack.

  #. **Explicitly Enable PTM and Configure HCI Transport Layer**

       On the stack side, the transport layer capability is defined in the
       ``build_config.opt`` file under the ``Tools`` folder. To enable the
       transport layer, this file will need to be modified to define
       ``HCI_TL_PTM``. The stack can now be notified to enter PTM via the
       ``HCI_EXT_EnablePTMCmd()`` Vendor Specific HCI Command.

  #. **Configure NPI to Forward Responses to Transport Protocol**

       Events and status of commands should be sent back to the transport
       protocol. This is done by registering callback functions with the
       transport layer which forward the messages to NPI. Once NPI has the
       messages, it then will send the message to the transport protocol
       configured.

Stack Project Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Preprocessor Defines
""""""""""""""""""""
These defines are located in the ``.opt`` file in the stack's ``Tools/defines``
folder. Select the ``.opt`` that is appropriate to the current build
configuration (FlashROM_Library, etc.). For additional information on adding
ICall Aware Tasks, and the modifications made to the Application and
Stack Projects see
:ref:`sec-creating-custom-ble-application-creating-additional-tasks`.

Add or modify (if it pre-exists) the following preprocessor defines:

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 2
    :caption: Stack Preprocessor Defines

    ...
    -DOSAL_MAX_NUM_PROXY_TASKS=4
    ...

``OSAL_MAX_NUM_PROXY_TASKS`` increases by one to accommodate for an NPI Task to
be created. So this should increase by one based on your appplication's
current value. The value of 4 here is used as an example.


Enable PTM and Configure HCI Transport Layer
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The HCI Transport Layer needs to be configured to use the correct
jump table.

On the stack side, the transport layer capabilities is defined in the
``build_config.opt`` file under the ``Tools`` folder. By default no
transport layer is included on the stack side to save flash.

In this example, the following modification in ``build_config.opt``
to enable PTM commands:

  .. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    /* Include Transport Layer (Full or PTM) */
    /* -DHCI_TL_NONE Comment this line */
    -DHCI_TL_PTM
    /* -DHCI_TL_FULL */

The stack must now be rebuilt for the changes to take effect and ensure support
for the PTM commands.

Application Project Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Preprocessor Defines
""""""""""""""""""""
These defines are located in the ``.opt`` file in the app's ``Tools/defines``
folder. Select the ``.opt`` that is appropriate to the current build
configuration (Release, Debug, etc.).

Add or modify (if it pre-exists) the following preprocessor defines:

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 3, 4
    :caption: Application Preprocessor Defines

    ...
    -DICALL_MAX_NUM_TASKS=4
    -DNPI_USE_UART
    -DNPI_FLOW_CTRL=0
    ...

``ICALL_MAX_NUM_TASKS`` increases by one to accommodate for an NPI Task to
be created. So this should increase by one based on your appplication's
current value. The value of 4 here is used as an example.

``NPI_USE_UART`` enables UART as the transport protocol for NPI.
A transport protocol is used to transfer commands and status between
a BLE HCI Tester and the application. NPI currently supports SPI and UART
protocols.

NPI by default utilizes a handshake/flow control system to signal
when a slave is ready to transmit/receive and when a master is
ready to transmit/receive. For testing purposes,
this functionality isn't needed and is disabled with ``NPI_FLOW_CTRL=0``.

Adding NPI and ICall HCI TL Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To add NPI and the ICall HCI TL file to the project, add the following files
to your application. Replace **<SDK>** with your SDK's file path.
You may want to copy these files into the project instead of linking it to
prevent unwanted SDK modifications:

  .. code-block:: none

    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\npi_frame_hci.c
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\npi_rxbuf.c
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\npi_task.c
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\npi_tl.c
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\npi_tl_uart.c
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\icall\app\icall_hci_tl.c

  .. figure:: resources/ptm_npi_include_folder.jpg

      Added Files in NPI Folder (IAR)

  .. figure:: resources/ptm_hci_tl.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 50%

      Added File in ICallBLE Folder (IAR)

If not added already, within your application’s project settings add the NPI and
ROM (for ICall) include directory to the include search path for the IDE:

 .. code-block:: none

    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\npi\src\inc
    <SDK>\source\ti\ble5stack\rom

     :align: center
     :width: 85%

     ROM Include Directories (IAR)

Creating the NPI Task in main.c
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The following changes are to be made in the ``Startup/main.c`` file.
To include the NPI Task into the project, add ``npi_task.h`` to ``main.c``
and add ``NPITask_createTask(ICALL_SERVICE_CLASS_BLE);`` towards the end of
``main()`` where tasks are being created.

  .. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 11-12

    #include "simple_peripheral.h"
    #include "npi_task.h"

    //...

    int main()
    {

      //...

      /* Start task for NPI task */
      NPITask_createTask(ICALL_SERVICE_CLASS_BLE);

      /* enable interrupts and start SYS/BIOS */
      BIOS_start();
      //...

    }

Set the NPI Task Priority
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
The NPI task must be set to a proper priority in ``npi_task.c``.
Ideally it should be lower than the stack task, but higher than the GAP task.
This allows commands to interrupt tasks if required.

For this example, the priority of 4 worked perfectly:

  .. code-block:: c

    //! \brief Task priority for NPI RTOS task
    #define NPITASK_PRIORITY 4


Modifying the App File
""""""""""""""""""""""
The following changes are to be made in the application's ``.c`` file.
This example will be provided with the context of ``simple_peripheral.c``.
Refer to the added comments for further information.

Include the following header files:

  .. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 5-7

    //...

    #include "simple_peripheral.h"

    #include "npi_task.h"        // To allow RX event registration
    #include "npi_ble.h"         // To enable transmission of messages to UART
    #include "icall_hci_tl.h"    // To allow ICall HCI Transport Layer

    //...

        pNpiPkt->hdr.status = 0xFF;
        pNpiPkt->pktLen = len;
        pNpiPkt->pData  = (uint8 *)(pNpiPkt + 1);

        memcpy(pNpiPkt->pData, buf, len);

        // Send to NPI
        // Note: there is no need to free this packet.  NPI will do that itself.
        NPITask_sendToHost((uint8_t *)pNpiPkt);
      }
    }

At the end of the initialization function, add the following function calls:

  .. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 8-9, 11-12, 14-15, 17-18

    //...

      // Inform Stack to Initialize PTM
      HCI_EXT_EnablePTMCmd();

    }

    //...

At the end of the process stack message function, add the following:

 .. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 13-48

    //...

    static uint8_t SimpleBLEPeripheral_processStackMsg(ICall_Hdr *pMsg)
    {

When PTM is enabled, a ``HCI_ResetCmd()`` is issued. This resets the controller
and various parts of the stack. PTM should be configured such that it’s only
enabled if a particular set of GPIOs or other signals are in a particular state.
Else the regular application should run. So the following functions in the app
should be called when PTM is desired by the developer.
For example, ``PTM_ENABLE_FLAG`` can be set to a value when specific conditions
are met, such as when a GPIO is toggled during start up:

  .. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 1-2, 14

    if(PTM_ENABLE_FLAG)
    {
      // Intercept NPI RX events.
      NPITask_registerIncomingRXEventAppCB(SBP_handleNPIRxInterceptEvent, INTERCEPT);

      // Register for Command Status information
      HCI_TL_Init(NULL, (HCI_TL_CommandStatusCB_t) SBP_sendToNPI, NULL, selfEntity);

      // Register for Events
      HCI_TL_getCmdResponderID(ICall_getLocalMsgEntityId(ICALL_SERVICE_CLASS_BLE_MSG, selfEntity));

      // Inform Stack to Initialize PTM
      HCI_EXT_EnablePTMCmd();
    }

With the project now modified, the PTM configuration will now be entered at
run-time. The application's only functionality will be to receive PTM commands
over HCI and send a response over HCI. PTM is only a subset of HCI commands and
it won't be able to do anything other than the commands found in the
``hciCmdTable`` found in ``hci_tl.c``. Check this file for the latest table of
supported commands.

.. _optimizing-ble-memory-usage:

Optimizing Bluetooth low energy Stack Memory Usage
--------------------------------------------------

Configuration of the Bluetooth low energy protocol stack is
essential for maximizing the amount of RAM and flash memory
available for the application. Refer to :ref:`stack_features_configuration` to configure
parameters that impact runtime RAM usage, such as the maximum
allowable size and number of PDUs. The TI Bluetooth low energy
protocol stack is implemented to use a small RAM footprint, and
allow the application to control the behavior of the stack by using
the runtime ICall heap. For example, an application that only sends
one GATT notification per connection event must store only one PDU
in the heap, whereas as an application that must send multiple
notifications must enqueue multiple PDUs in the heap.

To increase the available flash memory allocated to the application
project, minimize the flash usage of the protocol stack by including
only Bluetooth low energy features required to implement the defined
role of the device. The available protocol stack configurable
features are described in :ref:`stack_features_configuration`.
Adding additional features to the protocol stack has the net effect
of reducing the amount of flash memory to the application.

Additional Memory Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following tips can be used to minimize RAM and flash usage by
the protocol stack:

  1.  Verify that your application uses the *optimize for flash size*
      compiler optimization settings (default for TI projects).

  2.  Use only one page of SNV or do not use any NV pages if the GAP bond
      manager is not required. Set the ``NO_OSAL_SNV`` stack preprocessor
      option. See :ref:`using-simple-nv` for a description of SNV.

  3.  Exclude the GATT client functionality by defining the
      ``GATT_NO_CLIENT`` predefined symbol in the stack project for
      peripheral devices. (Peripheral devices do not typically
      implement the GATT client role.)

  4.  Remove or exclude debug DISPLAY drivers from the application project
      (see :ref:`development-and-debugging-dynamic-allocation-errors`).

  5.  Exclude Bluetooth low energy features from the Bluetooth low energy
      stack that are not used.

See :ref:`development-and-debugging-check-system-flash-and-ram-usage-with-map-file` for
the procedure to check the size of the configured protocol stack.

Defining Bluetooth Low Energy Behavior
--------------------------------------

This step involves using Bluetooth low energy protocol stack APIs to
define the system behavior and adding profiles, defining the GATT
database, configuring the security model, and so forth. Use the
concepts explained in :ref:`the_stack` as well as the Bluetooth low energy
API reference in :ref:`ble_api_reference`.
