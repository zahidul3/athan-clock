BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 to BLE5-Stack 1.02.01
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 to
a BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.02.01. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 into the BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.c``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 1.02.00 project.

#. Addition of privacy features to sample applications

    The sample applications included in the SDK now have Privacy enabled by
    default. The following changes have been introduced in BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 to
    the simple\_peripheral project in ``simple_peripheral.c``.

    The address mode has been modified to always use Resolvable Private Address
    with Public Identity Address shown below.

    .. code-block:: c

        #define DEFAULT_ADDRESS_MODE                  ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID

    .. attention::

        The following instructions influence multi\_role and simple\_central or
        projects in which there is a central device.

    A few of the other sample applications such as multi\_role and
    simple\_central have other changes that can influence the behavior of the
    application. For example, in `simple_central.c` there is now a Pair State
    Data struct to handle an additional callback in the GapBondMgr.

    .. code-block:: c

        // Container to store paring state info when passing from gapbondmgr callback
        // to app event. See the pfnPairStateCB_t documentation from the gapbondmgr.h
        // header file for more information on each parameter.
        typedef struct
        {
          uint16_t connHandle;
          uint8_t  status;
        } scPairStateData_t;

    Also, when pairing the device now needs to determine if the peer device was
    using a private address and update the connection list with the Public ID address.

    .. code-block:: c

        static void SimpleCentral_processPairState(uint8_t state,
                                           scPairStateData_t* pPairData)
        {
          uint8_t status = pPairData->status;

          if (state == GAPBOND_PAIRING_STATE_STARTED)
          {
            Display_printf(dispHandle, SC_ROW_CUR_CONN, 0, "Pairing started");
          }
          else if (state == GAPBOND_PAIRING_STATE_COMPLETE)
          {
            if (status == SUCCESS)
            {
              linkDBInfo_t linkInfo;

              Display_printf(dispHandle, SC_ROW_CUR_CONN, 0, "Pairing success");

              if (linkDB_GetInfo(pPairData->connHandle, &linkInfo) == SUCCESS)
              {
                // If the peer was using private address, update with ID address
                if ((linkInfo.addrType == ADDRTYPE_PUBLIC_ID ||
                     linkInfo.addrType == ADDRTYPE_RANDOM_ID) &&
                     !Util_isBufSet(linkInfo.addrPriv, 0, B_ADDR_LEN))
                {
                  // Update the address of the peer to the ID address
                  Display_printf(dispHandle, SC_ROW_NON_CONN, 0, "Addr updated: %s",
                                 Util_convertBdAddr2Str(linkInfo.addr));

                  // Update the connection list with the ID address
                  uint8_t i = SimpleCentral_getConnIndex(pPairData->connHandle);

                  SIMPLECENTRAL_ASSERT(i < MAX_NUM_BLE_CONNS);
                  memcpy(connList[i].addr, linkInfo.addr, B_ADDR_LEN);
                }
              }
            }

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

    The following drivers have changed from BLE5-Stack 1.02.00. Please see the
    changes to these drivers by comparing the supplied headers between those in
    the SimpleLink CC26x2 SDK v2.10.00.44 and those in the latest SimpleLink CC26x2S SDK.

    * Power: The Power Policy Manager has had minor changes to #defines provided.

#. Refer to the |TIRTOSUPGRADE| for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

    For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 1.02.01 uses TI-RTOS see
    :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`

    For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel Users Guide`_ and
    `Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.

#. Other porting concerns

    For other porting concerns, we recommend that the developer do a diff between
    an example that most closely resembles the functionality of your application
    from the latest SimpleLink CC26x2 SDK and the same example from the SimpleLink
    CC26x2 SDK v2.10.00.44 to see all potential changes.
