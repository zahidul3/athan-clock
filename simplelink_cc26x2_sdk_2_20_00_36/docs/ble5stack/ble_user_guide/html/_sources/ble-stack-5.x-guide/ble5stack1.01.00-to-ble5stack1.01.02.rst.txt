BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 to BLE5-Stack 1.01.02
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 to
a BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.01.02. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 into the BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.c``
    - ``simple_gatt_profile.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 example if additional tasks were added in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.00 project.

#. Note that address mode and random address are now set from ``GAP_DeviceInit``

    The ``GAP_DeviceInit()`` function now includes parameters for setting the
    address mode and for setting a pointer to a random address when that mode is
    used.

    .. code-block:: c

        /**
         * GAP Device Initialization
         *
         * Setup the device. Can only be called once per reset. In order to change
         * the address mode / random address, it is necessary to reset the device
         * and call this API again. In the case where the address mode or random address
         * is different than it was for the last initialization, all bonds and local
         * information stored in NV will be erased.
         *
         * @par Corresponding Events:
         * @ref GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT of type @ref gapDeviceInitDoneEvent_t
         *
         * @param profileRole GAP Profile Roles: @ref GAP_Profile_Roles
         * @param taskID end application task to receive unprocessed GAP events.
         * @param addrMode Own address mode. If always using Resolvable Private Address,
         *        set this to either @ref ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID or
         *        @ref ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_RANDOM_ID. If always using Identity
         *        Address, set this to either @ref ADDRMODE_PUBLIC or
         *        @ref ADDRMODE_RANDOM.
         * @param pRandomAddr Pointer to 6-byte Random Static Address of this device
         *        that will be copied to the stack. Valid only if addrMode
         *        is @ref ADDRMODE_RANDOM or @ref ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_RANDOM_ID and can
         *        not be NULL in these cases. Ignored for other address types.
         *
         * @return @ref SUCCESS : initialization started
         * @return @ref INVALIDPARAMETER : invalid profile role, role combination,
         *         or invalid Random Static Address,
         * @return @ref bleIncorrectMode : initialization has already occurred
         * @return @ref bleInternalError : error erasing NV
         */
        extern bStatus_t GAP_DeviceInit(uint8_t profileRole, uint8_t taskID,
                                        GAP_Addr_Modes_t addrMode,
                                        uint8_t* pRandomAddr);

    Any calls to ``GAP_DeviceInit()`` should be modified to pass a parameter
    addrMode of type ``GAP_Addr_Modes_t``.

    .. code-block:: c

        // Address mode of the local device
        #define DEFAULT_ADDRESS_MODE                  ADDRMODE_PUBLIC

    .. code-block:: c

        // Address mode
        static GAP_Addr_Modes_t addrMode = DEFAULT_ADDRESS_MODE;

    .. code-block:: c

        //Initialize GAP layer for Peripheral role and register to receive GAP events
        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_PERIPHERAL, selfEntity, addrMode, NULL);

    Additionally, remove all code using ``GAP_ConfigDeviceAddr()`` because the
    address mode and random address are now only able to be set from
    ``GAP_DeviceInit()``. ``GAP_DeviceInit()`` can only be called once after a
    reset, so any functions related to change the address mode on the fly should
    be removed.

#. Removal of HCI Extension notice commands:

    The following HCI Extension commands have been removed:
        - ``HCI_EXT_ConnEventNoticeCmd()``
        - ``HCI_EXT_AdvEventNoticeCmd()``
        - ``HCI_EXT_ScanEventNoticeCmd()``
        - ``HCI_EXT_ScanReqRptCmd()``

    Any calls to these commands should be removed as well as references to
    events related to these commands.

    For ``HCI_EXT_ConnEventNoticeCmd()``, ``Gap_RegisterConnEventCb`` is now
    provided  as an option instead as a way to handle connection events.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

    The following drivers have changed from BLE5-Stack 1.01.00. Please see the
    changes to these drivers by comparing the supplied headers between them in
    simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_1_50_00_71 and those in the |SDK|.

    * LCD: Driver is found in source/ti/display/lcd instead of previous ti/mw/lcd/

#. Refer to the |TIRTOSUPGRADE| for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

    For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 uses TI-RTOS see
    :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`

    For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel Users Guide`_ and
    `Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.
