Threading Modules
-----------------

The TI-RTOS kernel manages four distinct context levels of thread execution as
shown in :numref:`fig-tirtos-threads` The list of thread modules are shown below in
a descending order in terms of priority.

* A :term:`Hwi` or Hardware interrupt

* A :term:`Swi` or Software interrupt

* Tasks

* The :term:`Idle Task` for background idle functions

    TI-RTOS Execution Threads

This section describes these four execution threads and various structures used
throughout the TI-RTOS for messaging and synchronization.

Hardware Interrupts (Hwi)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hwi threads (also called Interrupt Service Routines or ISRs) are the threads
with the highest priority in a TI-RTOS application. Hwi threads are used to
perform time critical tasks that are subject to hard deadlines. They are
triggered in response to external asynchronous events (interrupts) that occur in
the real-time environment. Hwi threads always run to completion but can be
preempted temporarily by Hwi threads triggered by other interrupts, if enabled.
Specific information on the nesting, vectoring, and functionality of interrupts
can be found in the |TRM|.

Generally, interrupt service routines are kept short as not to affect the
hard real-time system requirements. Also, as Hwis must run to completion, no
blocking APIs may be called from within this context.

TI-RTOS drivers that require interrupts will initialize the required interrupts
for the assigned peripheral.

.. note::

    :ref:`sec-debugging` provides an example of using GPIOs and Hwis.
    While the SDK includes a peripheral driver library to abstract hardware
    register access, it is suggested to use the thread-safe TI-RTOS drivers.

The Hwi module for the |DEVICE| also supports :term:`Zero-latency interrupts`.
These interrupts do not go through the TI-RTOS Hwi dispatcher and therefore are
more responsive than standard interrupts, however this feature prohibits its
interrupt service routine from invoking any TI-RTOS kernel APIs directly. It is
up to the ISR to preserve its own context to prevent it from interfering with
the kernel's scheduler.

Software Interrupts (Swi)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patterned after hardware interrupts (:term:`Hwi`), software interrupt threads
provide additional priority levels between Hwi threads and Task threads. Unlike
Hwis, which are triggered by hardware interrupts, Swis are triggered
programmatically by calling certain Swi module APIs. Swis handle threads
subject to time constraints that preclude them from being run as tasks, but
whose deadlines are not as severe as those of hardware ISRs. Like Hwis, Swi
threads always run to completion. Swis allow Hwis to defer less critical
processing to a lower-priority thread, minimizing the time the CPU spends
inside an interrupt service routine, where other Hwis can be disabled. Swis
require only enough space to save the context for each Swi interrupt priority
level, while Tasks use a separate stack for each thread.

Similar with Hwis, Swis should be kept to short and may not include any
blocking API calls. This allows high priority tasks such as the wireless
protocol stack to execute as needed. It is suggested to ``_post()`` some
TI-RTOS synchronization primitive to allow for further post processing from
within a Task context. See :numref:`fig-preemption-scenario` to illustrate such
a use-case.

    Preemption Scenario

The commonly used Clock module operates from within a Swi context. It is
important that functions called by a Clock object do not invoke blocking APIs
and are rather short in execution.

Task
^^^^

Task threads have higher priority than the background (Idle) thread and lower
priority than software interrupts. Tasks differ from software interrupts in
that they can wait (block) during execution until necessary resources are
available. Tasks require a separate stack for each thread. TI-RTOS provides a
number of mechanisms that can be used for inter-task communication and
synchronization. These include Semaphores, Event, Message queues, and
Mailboxes.

Idle Task
^^^^^^^^^
Idle threads execute at the lowest priority in a TI-RTOS application and are
executed one after another in a continuous loop (the Idle Loop). After main
returns, a TI-RTOS application calls the startup routine for each TI-RTOS module
and then falls into the Idle Loop. Each thread must wait for all others to
finish executing before it is called again. The Idle Loop runs continuously
except when it is preempted by higher-priority threads. Only functions that do
not have hard deadlines should be executed in the Idle Loop.

For |DEVICE| devices, the Idle Task allows the Power Policy Manager to enter
the lowest allowable power savings.
