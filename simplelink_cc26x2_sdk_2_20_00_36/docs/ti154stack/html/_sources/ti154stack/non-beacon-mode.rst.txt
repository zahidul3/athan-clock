Non-Beacon Mode
===============

Introduction
------------

The IEEE 802.15.4 specification defines the non-beacon mode of network
operation where the coordinator does not send out periodic beacons. The non-
beacon mode is an asynchronous network mode of operation where the devices
communicate by using the :term:`CSMA/CA` mechanism.

Network Operations
------------------

Network Start-Up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A network is always started by a full function device. The procedure to start
the network begins with a MAC layer reset. The application can directly start
the network on a desired channel with a desired or random PAN-ID, or it can
first check for a channel with lowest RF energy by performing a energy detect
scan to select the channel with lowest energy or least interference (see
:numref:`fig-non-beacon-network-start-up-sequence`). The application then
performs an active scan to detect the existing networks in the area, and
select network parameters for its own network which do not conflict. After
selecting the channel, the PAN Coordinator application must set the short
address and PAN-ID, and then set the beacon payload and (optionally) turn
on the associate permit flag if it wants new devices to join the network.
The network is then started using the API ``ApiMac_mlmeStartReq()`` with the
``panCoordinator`` parameter set to TRUE.

Network Join
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a device is ready to join a non-beacon network, it must first perform an
active scan broadcasting a beacon request. After receiving the beacon request,
the non-beacon PAN coordinators in the radio range of the device respond with
their beacons. When the scan is complete, TI 15.4-Stack calls the registered
callback of type ``ApiMac_scanCnfFp_t`` with the PAN descriptors of the beacons
it has received during the scan to the device application. The device
application examines the PAN descriptors and selects a coordinator.

The next step is to perform the network association (see
:numref:`fig-non-beacon-association-sequence`). The device application calls
the ``ApiMac_mlmeAssociateReq()`` API to send the association request
message to the coordinator. The association process is successful when the
device application receives the association confirmation from the TI
15.4-Stack layer.

Data Exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sequence diagram in :numref:`fig-non-beacon-direct-data-sequence` depicts
the various direct data transactions between a device and a coordinator in a
non-beacon network.

    Non-beacon Mode Direct Data Exchange Sequence

The sequence diagram in :numref:`fig-non-beacon-indirect-data-sequence` depicts
the indirect data transaction in a non-beacon network.

Maintaining a Connection for End Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the device application receives repeated communication failures following
requests to transmit data, the device application may conclude that it has been
orphaned and can initiate an orphaned-device realignment procedure.
:numref:`fig-non-beacon-orphan-sequence` shows the non-beacon mode orphan
sequence.

In the orphan realignment procedure, the device application requests TI
15.4-Stack to perform the orphan scan over a specified set of channels by using
the ``ApiMac_MlmeScanReq()`` API with the scan-type parameter set to orphan
scan. For each channel specified, TI 15.4-Stack at the device switches to the
channel and then sends an orphan notification command. After successfully
transmitting the orphan notification command, the MAC layer enables the
receiver for at most ``ApiMac_attribute_responseWaitTime``. If the device
successfully receives a coordinator realignment command, the device terminates
the scan and calls the registered callback of type ``ApiMac_scanCnfFp_t``. At
the coordinator side, the reception of the orphan notification command results
in the call of the registered callback of type ``ApiMac_orphanIndFp_t`` by TI
15.4-Stack. If the coordinator application finds the record of the device, it
sends a coordinator realignment command to the orphaned device by using the
``ApiMac_MlmeOrphanRsp()`` call.

Disassociating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two scenarios are described in the following: the first is initiated by the
coordinator and the second is initiated by the device.
:numref:`fig-non-beacon-indirect-disassociation-sequence` shows the indirect
disassociation sequence initiated by the non-beacon mode coordinator.

When the coordinator application wants one of the associated devices must leave
the PAN, the coordinator application requests that TI 15.4-Stack send the
disassociation notification command by using the
``ApiMac_mlmeDiassociateReq()`` call. If the ``txIndirect`` parameter is set to
TRUE, TI 15.4-Stack sends the disassociation notification command to the device
using indirect transmission; then, the disassociation notification command is
added to the list of pending transactions stored on the coordinator and pulled
by the device using data request command.

The end device application can also initiate the disassociation process as
described in :numref:`fig-non-beacon-device-disassociation-sequence`, which
shows the sequence of messages exchanged when the end device initiates the
disassociation process in the non-beacon network.

Stack Configuration Knobs
-------------------------

Attribute Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ApiMac_attribute_associatePermit`` is used by the coordinator application
to indicate to the joining devices whether association is allowed or not. When
the coordinator sets this attribute item to TRUE, this indicates to the joining
devices within the beacon frame that association is allowed.
:numref:`tab-non-beacon-configuration` lists the attribute configurations that
apply to non-beacon mode.

If set to TRUE, the ``ApiMac_attribute_RxOnWhenIdle`` enables the receiver
during the idle period.

Configuration Constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TI 15.4-Stack uses a structure containing various user-configurable parameters
(at compile time). This structure, called ``macCfg_t``, is in the ``mac_cfg.c``
file. :numref:`tab-non-beacon-config-constants` lists the configuration
elements.
