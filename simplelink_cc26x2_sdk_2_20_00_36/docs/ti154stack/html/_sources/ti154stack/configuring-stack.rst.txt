Configuring Stack
=================

Mode Configuration
------------------

The TI 15.4-Stack offers three modes of network operations that follow (and as
discussed in this chapter):

-   Beacon mode

-   Nonbeacon mode

-   Frequency-hopping mode

-   BLE Advertising Mode

The ``features.h`` file allows developers to compile-in or compile-out different
15.4-Stack features for different applications. TI 15.4-Stack allows support for
all three modes or allows user to select just one desired mode of network
operation. TI 15.4-Stack can be configured in four different modes of operation
using the ``features.h`` file. Depending on the mode selection, considerable
savings in the executable-image space can be achieved.
:numref:`tab-collector-flags` and :numref:`tab-sensor-flags` provide a summary
of Flash and RAM use of the out-of-box Collector and Sensor Example Application
with different compile options enabled.

#.  ``FEATURE_ALL_MODES``: When this compile flag is defined, the image is
    compiled with all the three modes of operation (frequency-hopping mode,
    beacon-enabled mode and non-beacon mode) and the configuration file
    ``config.h`` can be used to select the specific mode for network operation.
    This feature allows flexibility to select any mode for the device. For the
    out-of-box collector and sensor example application, this feature is
    enabled.::

        /*! If defined, builds the image with all the modes of operation (frequency hopping, beacon mode and non beacon mode) */
        #define FEATURE_ALL_MODES

#.  ``FEATURE_FREQ_HOP_MODE``: Defining this compile flag will compile only the
    frequency hopping mode of operation in the final executable image. For out
    of box example application, you would need to disable the compile option
    ``FEATURE_ALL_MODES`` and then enable this compile option as in the
    following:::

        /*! If defined, builds the image with all the modes of operation (frequency hopping, beacon mode and non beacon mode) */
        #undef FEATURE_ALL_MODES

        /*! If defined, builds the image with the frequency mode of operation */
        #define FEATURE_FREQ_HOP_MODE

#.  ``FEATURE_BEACON_MODE``: Defining this compile flag will compile only the
    beacon mode of operation in the final executable image. For out of box
    example application, you would need to disable the compile option
    ``FEATURE_ALL_MODES`` and then enable this compile option as in the
    following:::

        /*! If defined, builds the image with all the modes of operation (frequency hopping, beacon mode and non beacon mode) */
        #undef FEATURE_ALL_MODES

        /*! If defined, builds the image with beacon mode of operation */
        #define FEATURE_BEACON_MODE

#.  ``FEATURE_NON_BEACON_MODE``: Defining this compile flag will compile only
    the non-beacon mode of operation in the final executable image.::

        /*! If defined, builds the image with all the modes of operation (frequency hopping, beacon mode and non beacon mode) */
        #undef FEATURE_ALL_MODES

        /*! If defined, builds the image with non beacon mode of operation */
        #define FEATURE_NON_BEACON_MODE

#.  FEATURE_BLE_SUPPORT: Defining this compile flag will enable BLE operations
    in the stack. CONFIG_BLE_SUPPORT will also need to be configured in config.h for
    the example application to send out BLE beacons.

In addition to the compile flags listed previously, the
``FEATURE_FULL_FUNCTION_DEVICE`` compile flag is required for the PAN
Coordinator device (see the out-of-box Collector Example Application) to perform
the role as a central node in the network.

Also, the ``FEATURE_MAC_SECURITY`` compile flag is added in the ``features.h``
file to allow the ability to turn the MAC layer security on and turn off in the
compile executable image. If the mac layer security is turned off, you will need
the version of the stack library with no MAC security.

To build the image with no security, perform the steps that follow:

#.  Select the linker *File Search Path* option.

#.  Modify to include the ``maclib_nosecure.a`` instead of ``maclib_secure.a``
    library file (shown in :numref:`fig-stack-library`).

        Changing TI 15.4 Stack library

The ``PREAMBLE_COMPATIBILITY`` compile flag allows the stack to be compatible
with previous versions of TI 15.4-Stack. When this flag is not defined the stack
uses a IEEE 802.15.4g compliant preamble. If this flag is enabled, a new version
of the stack library is required.

Similar to the steps above, to change the stack library for compatibility:

#.  Select the linker *File Search Path* option.
#.  Modify to include the ``maclib_nosecureLegacy.a`` or
    ``maclib_secureLegacy.a`` library file depending on whether or not security
    is enabled or disabled.

.. note:: ``FEATURE_BLE_SUPPORT`` will add around 6KB of flash and 1.2KB of RAM
    to any of the modes described above except for ``FEATURE_ALL_MODES``.

CC1190 PA/LNA Support
---------------------

CC1190 PA/LNA can be used to enhance the transmit power of the device using the
external Power Amplifier. If the system uses an external CC1190 external PA/LNA,
the stack should be configured to use the appropriate power tables. This can be
achieved by setting the PIB attribute ``ApiMac_attribute_rangeExtender`` to 1.
It is required to set this attribute first before setting the PIB attribute
``ApiMac_attribute_phyTransmitPowerSigned`` to set the required power level.
When CC1190 is enable the following output power values will only be supported:
18, 23, 25, 26 and 27 dbm. When other values are requested, a status of
ApiMac_status_invalidParameter will be returned. For the :term:`OOB` |TIMAC|
applications, CC1190 PA/LNA support can be enabled by setting the configuration
option ``CONFIG_RANG_EXT_MODE`` to ``APIMAC_HIGH_GAIN_MODE``.

CC1352P1 and CC1352P2 Support
-----------------------------

The CC1352P1 and CC1352P2 have an integrated power amplifier that can be used to
increase transmit power of the device. 

The CC1352P1 device adds a power amplifier to the Sub1-GHz RF path. This will
increase the maximum transmit power of the device from +14 dBm to +20 dBm. For
the :term:`OOB` |TIMAC| applications, power amplifier support can be enabled by
setting the configuration option ``CONFIG_PA_TYPE`` to ``APIMAC_HIGH_PA``.

The CC1352P2 device adds a power amplifier to the 2.4 GHz RF path. This will
increase the maximum transmit power from +5 dBm to +20 dBm. For the :term:`OOB`
|TIMAC| applications, power amplifier support can be enabled by setting the
configuration option ``CONFIG_PA_TYPE`` to ``APIMAC_HIGH_PA``.

.. note::
    The CC1352P2 will only increase transmit power for projects configured for
    operation in 2.4 GHz. The symbol ``FREQ_2_4G`` should be defined in the
    projects predefined symbols for operation in 2.4 GHz.

Bluetooth Low Energy Advertiser
-------------------------------

The TI 15.4-Stack supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements,
specifically, non-connectable undirected advertisements in simultaneous
operation with the TI 15.4 stack. Such simultaneous operation is available only
on the dual-band devices such as the CC1350.
The TI 15.4 stack uses uBLE (pronounced micro BLE) stack subsystem which is a
tiny light-weight non-connection based protocol stack module that supports only
BLE Broadcaster role. It does not operate using a separate TI-RTOS stack but is
integrated in the application. This saves memory and overhead required to
maintain a separate RTOS task.  Since uBLE supports only BLE Broadcaster role,
there is no strict timing constraint. Therefore uBLE radio operation have lower
priority compared to 15.4 radio operations. This implies that 15.4 radio
operations will preempt uBLE operations.

.. note:: The BLE advertisement payload is fully modifiable. Any of the
    out-of-box example sensor applications can be configured to enable BLE
    advertisements.

Configuring uBLE Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``FEATURE_BLE``: Defining this compile flag in ``features.h`` will compile the
BLE advertisement feature.::

    /*! If defined, builds the image wih BLE Advertiser enabled */
    #define FEATURE_BLE

``CONFIG_BLE_SUPPORT``: Apart from ``FEATURE_BLE`` this configuration must be
set to true in ``config.h``:::

    /*! Enable BLE advertiser   */
    #define CONFIG_BLE_SUPPORT          true

The BLE advertisement interval can be modified as follows in ``ble_adv.c``:::

    #define DEFAULT_ADVERTISING_INTERVAL    2000

.. note:: The units are in terms of 0.625 milliseconds. Hence setting it to
    2000 will result in BLE advertisements being sent out every 1.25 seconds.

.. _sec-security:

Security
--------

The TI 15.4-Stack supports AES encryption as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4
Specification. The application is responsible for management of the keys. The
out-of-box example application of the TI 15.4-Stack demonstrates how to use
security with the TI 15.4-Stack.

.. note:: TI 15.4-Stack supports pair wise keys.
